pf9-mngt is an open-source operational management platform for Platform9 / OpenStack — it gives engineering and MSP teams automated snapshots, VM restore, full inventory persistence, and day-to-day monitoring in a single self-hosted stack.

---

## What pf9-mngt Is

- A **self-hosted operational layer** that continuously persists all Platform9 / OpenStack metadata into your own PostgreSQL database — independently of platform availability
- A **snapshot automation engine** built from scratch (no native scheduler exists in Platform9 or OpenStack): quota-aware, multi-tenant, policy-driven, with SLA compliance reporting
- A **VM restore system** with side-by-side and replace modes — full flavor, network, IP, credential, and volume automation (no native equivalent exists in OpenStack)
- A **migration planning workbench** from RVTools ingestion through cohort design, wave planning, and PCD auto-provisioning
- An **engineering dashboard** with 30+ management tabs, RBAC, full audit trail, metering/chargeback, notifications, runbooks, a support ticket system, and an AI Ops Copilot

---

## What pf9-mngt Is Not

- **Not a replacement for the official Platform9 UI** — it is a complementary operational layer that adds engineering workflows the native UI does not provide
- **Not an official Platform9 product** — it is an independent open-source project, not endorsed by or affiliated with Platform9 Systems, Inc.
- **Not a cloud control plane** — it does not replace Keystone, Nova, Cinder, or Neutron; it orchestrates them via their APIs
- **Not intended for end users** — it is an engineering and MSP operations console for the team managing the platform

## 🧭 Why This Exists — An Engineering Evaluation Story

The conversation around VMware alternatives is real and growing. For MSPs and enterprise teams evaluating their options, Platform9 on OpenStack is genuinely worth looking at. Solid technology, strong business model, and a credible path for organizations managing private and hybrid cloud at scale.

This project was built during a serious Platform9 evaluation — testing Platform9 as a potential direction for our infrastructure. During that process, like any serious evaluation, you go beyond the demo and start stress-testing real operational workflows. That is where engineering gaps become visible — not because the platform is lacking, but because MSP and enterprise operations have very specific day-to-day requirements that take time for any platform to fully mature into.

Rather than pause the evaluation, we chose to solve the gaps ourselves and reach a better, more informed decision point. The result is pf9-mngt. What started as an evaluation tool grew into a production-grade platform in its own right — 409+ commits, 121 releases, 15 containerized services, full CI pipeline, and Docker images published to ghcr.io.

This entire project was built using AI as a genuine engineering partner — what some call vibe coding, but applied to a real production problem with real architectural decisions. One person, clear intent, and the right AI workflow can ship something with genuine depth. That is worth demonstrating.

---

### 🔐 Engineering Gap 1 — Metadata Ownership & Operational Resilience

OpenStack identifies everything by UUID. Resource names, relationships, network topology, and tenant context all live in the metadata layer on the management cluster. When you run Platform9 in SaaS mode, that metadata lives on their platform — not yours.

From an engineering perspective this creates a real operational resilience challenge. Without that metadata layer your resources become very difficult to identify and manage independently at scale. For MSPs managing multiple tenants and hundreds of resources, this is a genuine business continuity risk.

**The engineering answer:** pf9-mngt continuously pulls and persists all infrastructure metadata into a local PostgreSQL database that you own and control — independently of the platform. Resource names, relationships, tenant context, change history, and full inventory are always available locally, regardless of platform availability. This is exactly what RVTools does for VMware environments. We built the equivalent for Platform9 and OpenStack.

---

### ⚡ Engineering Gap 2 — VM Restore

In VMware, restoring a VM is a right-click. In OpenStack, there is no equivalent native workflow. To recover a VM from a snapshot you must manually reconstruct everything — remember the original flavor, network topology, IP configuration, re-attach the snapshot volume, and preserve user credentials. All of this under SLA pressure, without making a mistake.

For an MSP, that manual process is not sustainable at scale. It is exactly the kind of procedure that goes wrong at the worst possible moment.

**The engineering answer:** pf9-mngt automates the entire restore procedure. The restore engine handles flavor, network topology, IP addresses, user credentials, and volume attachment automatically. Two restore modes are supported:

- **Side-by-side restore** — a new VM with a new name and new IP spins up alongside the original, completely non-destructively. Validate before cutover. Nothing is touched until you are ready.
- **Replace restore** — full automated recovery with the original configuration restored. Superadmin-only for safety.

Every restore operation is fully audited — who triggered it, what was restored, what mode, duration, and outcome. For MSP accountability and compliance this is not optional.

---

### 🔄 Engineering Gap 3 — Snapshot Automation & Compliance

There is no native automated snapshot scheduler in Platform9 or OpenStack. No configurable per-volume policies. No retention management. No SLA compliance tracking. For an MSP, snapshot automation is table stakes — you cannot deliver a managed service without it.

**The engineering answer:** pf9-mngt includes a complete snapshot automation engine built from scratch. Configurable policies per volume — daily, monthly, custom retention — with automatic cleanup and full SLA compliance reporting aggregated by tenant and domain. v1.26.0 adds **quota-aware batching** with Cinder quota pre-checks, tenant-grouped batching with configurable rate limits, live progress tracking, and the `snapshot_quota_forecast` proactive runbook.

---

### 📦 Engineering Gap 4 — VMware Migration Assessment & Capacity Planning

Migrating hundreds of VMs from VMware to PCD is not just "move the disks." You need full source inventory analysis, OS compatibility classification, warm-vs-cold mode determination, per-VM time estimation, cohort planning, and target capacity validation — before a single VM moves. No native tooling ties RVTools data to PCD readiness in one end-to-end workflow.

**The engineering answer:** pf9-mngt includes a full **Migration Planner** — a multi-stage workflow that takes you from raw RVTools data all the way to an approved, wave-sequenced migration plan ready for execution.

**📥 Source Inventory & Assessment**
- RVTools XLSX ingestion — parses vInfo, vPartition, vDisk, vNetwork sheets into a structured per-VM inventory
- Per-VM risk scoring (GREEN / YELLOW / RED) with configurable weighted rules (OS, disk size, NIC count, snapshots)
- Warm-eligible vs cold-required classification — based on risk score and operator overrides
- OS family and version detection; actual used-disk data from vPartition (not provisioned size)
- Per-VM time estimation — warm phase-1 copy, incremental sync, cutover window, and cold total downtime
- Excel + PDF export — Project Summary, Per-Tenant Assessment, Daily Schedule, All VMs

**🗺️ Target Mapping & Capacity Planning**
- Per-tenant scoping — mark tenants in or out of plan with bulk-select toolbar and exclusion reasons
- Source → PCD target mapping — map each tenant to a target PCD domain and project; auto-seeded with confirmed-flag review workflow
- Source → PCD network mapping — auto-seeded from VM inventory; VLAN ID, confirmed status, Find & Replace, Confirm All
- VM dependency annotation — mark app-stack ordering constraints (web → DB) with circular-dependency validation
- Per-tenant readiness checks — 5 auto-derived: target mapped, network mapped, quota sufficient, no critical gaps, VMs classified
- Overcommit profile modeling — Aggressive / Balanced / Conservative presets with configurable ratios
- Quota requirements engine — recommended per-tenant vCPU, RAM, and storage on the PCD side
- **Performance-based node sizing** — uses actual `cpu_usage_percent` / `memory_usage_percent` from RVTools data (not vCPU allocation ÷ overcommit) for accurate physical node demand; falls back to allocation or quota if performance data is unavailable
- Auto-detect PCD node profile from live hypervisor inventory with one click
- PCD readiness gap analysis — missing flavors, networks, images, unmapped tenants — with severity scoring and downloadable action report (Excel + PDF)

**🗃️ Cohort Planning**
- **Migration Cohorts** — split large projects into ordered workstreams, each with its own schedule, owner, and dependency gate
- **Tenant ease scoring** — composite 0–100 score per tenant based on VM count, disk size, risk score, OS support rate, network complexity, and cross-tenant dependencies; configurable dimension weights
- **Auto-assign strategies** — six algorithms: easiest-first, riskiest-last, pilot + bulk, balanced load, OS-first, by-priority; with guardrails (max VMs, max disk, max avg risk per cohort)
- **What-if estimator** — two side-by-side models per cohort (bandwidth/transfer model + VM-slots scheduler model); live recalculation as you adjust agent slots or bandwidth; project deadline banner turns red if either model exceeds the target duration
- Expandable cohort cards — avg ease, risk distribution, OS mix, readiness counts, and cross-cohort dependency warnings
- Gantt-style date bars and dependency lock indicators

**🌊 Wave Planning**
- Cohort-scoped auto-builder — builds independent wave sets per cohort in execution order; five strategies: bandwidth-paced, risk-tiered, even-spread, dependency-ordered, pilot-first
- Pilot wave support — auto-creates a low-risk pilot wave per cohort to validate toolchain before committing the bulk
- Full wave lifecycle — planned → confirmed → in-progress → complete, with timestamps and transition guards
- Per-wave pre-flight checklists — network mapped, target project set, VMs assessed, no critical gaps, agent reachable, snapshot baseline
- Wave Planner UI — VM migration funnel, per-cohort wave cards, VM assignment tables, preflight status panel, dry-run preview before committing
- **Wave Approval Gates** — each wave requires explicit approval before advancing to execution; approval request notifications, inline approve/reject with comment, gated advance button; approval status badge (⏳ pending / ✅ approved / ❌ rejected)
- **VM Dependency Auto-Import** — automatically detects implicit VM dependencies from RDM disk sharing (confidence 0.95) and shared-datastore co-location (confidence 0.70); dry-run preview before committing; source badges (💽 RDM / 🗄 DS) distinguish auto-imports from manually entered dependencies
- **Maintenance Window Scheduling** — define recurring per-project maintenance windows (day-of-week, start/end time, timezone, cross-midnight support); Auto-Build Waves stamps each wave with `scheduled_start`/`scheduled_end` from the next available slot; preview strip shows next 8 upcoming calendar bands

**⚙️ PCD Data Enrichment (Network Map, Flavor Staging, Image Checklist)**
- Source → PCD network mapping with VLAN IDs, confirmed status, Find & Replace, Confirm All; subnet details panel per row (CIDR, gateway, DNS, DHCP pool)
- **Excel template export/import** — download a pre-filled XLSX for bulk subnet entry; import back to update all rows at once; formula detection catches VLOOKUP external-reference issues with a clear fix instruction; diagnostic response pinpoints any row-matching failures
- **Confirm Subnets** one-click bulk action marks all rows with CIDR as subnet-confirmed; inline CIDR display in the Subnet Details column; import auto-confirms on CIDR presence
- Flavor Staging — de-duplicated per (vCPU, RAM) shape; match against live PCD Nova API; confirmed rows show "✓ exists" vs "✓ new" status pill; Find & Replace, Confirm All
- Image Requirements checklist — one row per OS family; confirm after uploading to PCD Glance; Match PCD auto-links to existing Glance images; status pill differentiates existing vs new images
- PCD Readiness Score — live readiness counter per resource type; gaps auto-resolve when mappings/staging/image requirements are confirmed; network gaps resolve when all confirmed mappings cover the gap list

**⚙️ PCD Auto-Provisioning (Prepare PCD)**
- **Readiness gate** — pre-flight check (`GET /prep-readiness`) verifies all four data enrichment items are confirmed (subnets, flavors, images, users) before allowing task generation
- **Ordered task plan generation** (`POST /prepare`) — builds 667+ provisioning tasks in strict dependency order: create domains → create projects → set quotas → create networks → create subnets → create flavors → create users → assign roles
- **Per-task execution** (`POST /prep-tasks/{id}/execute`) — each task executes against the live PCD Keystone / Neutron / Nova API; writes back PCD UUIDs to source tables (`target_network_id`, `pcd_flavor_id`, `pcd_user_id`, `temp_password`)
- **Run All** (`POST /prepare/run`) — executes all pending/failed tasks in order; stops on first new failure to prevent cascade
- **Per-task rollback** (`POST /prep-tasks/{id}/rollback`) — deletes the PCD resource and resets the task; domain rollback is safety-checked (refuses if domain still contains projects)
- **⚙️ Prepare PCD UI tab** — readiness grid (4 cards), Generate Plan + Run All buttons, task table with status badges, inline error expansion, auto-refresh every 3 s

**📊 Migration Summary & Tech Fix Time Estimation**
- **Fix time model** — per-VM post-migration effort score: Windows OS, extra volumes, extra NICs, cold migration, risk tier, snapshots, cross-tenant dependencies, unknown OS; multiplied by OS-family fix rate (Windows 50%, Linux 20%, Other 40%) to produce expected intervention time in minutes
- **`migration_fix_settings`** — per-project weight sliders and OS fix rates, auto-created with defaults; all 10 factors are tunable per project without code changes
- **Per-VM fix override** — operators can lock any individual VM to a specific fix time (bypassing the model); inline ⏱ Fix Time Override card in the expanded VM row with number input, Save, and Clear
- **Migration Summary tab** — executive KPI strip (Migration Days, In-Use Data TB with provisioned subtitle, Estimated Data-Copy Time, Estimated Fix Time, Total Downtime); **per-day schedule table** with cohort, VMs, storage (GB), wall-clock time, agent hours, cold/warm split, and risk breakdown per day; over-capacity days highlighted in red with ⚠️; OS-family breakdown table; per-cohort breakdown; methodology accordion; settings editor
- **Throughput cap engine** — daily schedule uses a shared-pipe GB/day ceiling (`effective_gbph × working_hours`) instead of per-slot hour packing; `wall_clock_hours` is correctly derived from `day_transfer_gb / effective_gbph`; `over_capacity` flag emitted when a day's payload exceeds the ceiling
- **Tenant filter dropdowns** — Scope, Ease, Cohort, and Network Type filters in the Tenants tab with a Clear Filters button

  - **VM**: Stuck VM Remediation, VM Health Quick Fix, Snapshot Before Escalation, Password Reset + Console Access, **VM Rightsizing** *(v1.55)* — identifies over-provisioned VMs and suggests/executes flavor downsizing with pre-snapshot safety, **DR Drill** *(v1.56)* — clone DR-tagged VMs into isolated network, verify boot, auto-teardown, **Hypervisor Maintenance Evacuate** *(v1.57, Phase C2)* — drain a hypervisor before maintenance: live-migrate all VMs (graph-depth ordered), cold-migrate fallback, disable host after drain
  - **Security**: Security Group Audit, Security & Compliance Audit, User Last Login Report, Snapshot Quota Forecast, **Security Group Hardening** *(v1.57, Phase C)* — replaces 0.0.0.0/0 rules with graph-derived CIDRs, **Network Isolation Audit** *(v1.57)* — scans shared networks, cross-tenant routers, CIDR overlaps, and unexpected FIPs, **Image Lifecycle Audit** *(v1.57)* — scores images by age + EOL OS + FIP exposure
  - **Quota**: Quota Threshold Check, Upgrade Opportunity Detector, **Quota Adjustment** *(v1.53)* — sets Nova/Neutron/Cinder quota with billing gate + dry-run diff
  - **General**: Orphan Resource Cleanup, Diagnostics Bundle, Monthly Executive Snapshot, Cost Leakage Report, **Org Usage Report** *(v1.53)* — full usage + cost report with email-ready HTML body, **Capacity Forecast** *(v1.55)* — linear regression on cluster vCPU/RAM history, projects days to 80% capacity, **Cluster Capacity Planner** *(v1.61)* — HA-aware cluster capacity analysis: reserves N+1/N+2 host headroom, 70% safe-operating threshold, forecasts days to capacity, recommends minimum host spec for 6-month runway, per-flavor VM slot table
  - **Provisioning**: **Tenant Offboarding** *(v1.56)* — 10-step customer exit: FIP release → VM stop → port cleanup → Keystone disable → metadata tagging → CRM notification → final report email
- **Department Visibility** *(v1.52)*: Admins control which departments see each runbook via a live checkbox matrix in the UI; non-admin users receive only the runbooks their department is allowed to trigger
- **External Integrations** *(v1.52)*: Connect billing gates, CRM systems, or generic webhooks. `auth_credential` Fernet-encrypted at rest. Action runbooks call `_call_billing_gate()` for pre-authorization before applying changes — silently skips if no integration is configured
- **Result Export**: Every runbook result can be exported as CSV, JSON, or printed to PDF directly from the detail panel
- **ILS Pricing from Metering**: Cost-related runbooks pull real pricing from the `metering_pricing` table — per-flavor, per-resource, with automatic currency detection (ILS/USD)
- **Operator-Facing Trigger**: Tier 1 operators can browse and trigger runbooks with dry-run support — no admin access needed
- **Flexible Approval Workflows**: Configurable `trigger_role → approver_role` mapping per runbook with three modes: auto-approve, single approval, multi-approval
- **Admin Governance**: Execution History, Approvals queue, and Approval Policies managed via 3 dedicated sub-tabs in the Admin panel
- **Full Audit Trail**: Every execution records trigger user, approver, timestamps, parameters, results, items found/actioned
- **Pluggable Engine Architecture**: `@register_engine` decorator pattern — add new runbooks with zero framework changes

### 🕸️ Cloud Dependency Graph *(v1.47 → v1.51)*
- **BFS Graph Engine**: `GET /api/graph` — given any resource (VM, volume, network, tenant, snapshot, SG, FIP, subnet, port, host, image, domain), returns the full node+edge dependency graph up to 3 hops; 150-node cap with `truncated` flag
- **12 Node Types, 15 Edge Types**: All relationships derived from the existing DB schema with no schema changes required
- **Health Score Engine** *(v1.51)*: Every node shows a coloured 0–100 score circle; VM/volume/host each have tailored deduction rules for error states, missing snapshots, drift, and resource pressure; capacity pressure tinting on host nodes
- **Blast Radius Mode** *(v1.51)*: Click 💥 to highlight all resources impacted if the selected node fails; animated edges + node dimming; summary banner showing affected VMs, tenants, FIPs, and volumes
- **Delete Impact Mode** *(v1.51)*: Click 🗑 to preview cascade deletions, stranded resources, and OpenStack blockers before any destructive action
- **Orphan Detection** *(v1.51)*: Surfaces orphaned volumes (unattached), floating IPs (no port), security groups (unused), and dangling snapshots; visible in Tenant Health Panel
- **Tenant Health Panel** *(v1.51)*: Environment health score, critical/degraded VM counts, orphan count, expandable top-issues list shown above the canvas in Topology mode
- **VMware Migration Graph** *(v1.48)*: RVTools-side dependency graph with VM, disk, and portgroup/VLAN nodes; migration status rings (🟢 complete / 🟡 in progress / 🔴 failed); view from any Migration Planner tenant row or cohort expansion
- **ReactFlow UI** (`DependencyGraph.tsx`): Dagre hierarchical layout, 12 color-coded node types, depth pills (1/2/3), type filter checkboxes, **🔍 Explore from here** re-rooting with ← Back breadcrumb; **🔗 Open in tab**, **📸 Create Snapshot**, and **🚀 View in Migration Planner** quick actions on any node
- **Auto-Ticket Integration** *(v1.59)*: Graph node health score < 40 triggers `auto_incident` ticket; `POST /api/graph/request-delete` creates an `auto_change_request` before any destructive delete

### 🤖 Ops Copilot — AI Infrastructure Assistant *(v1.24)*
- **Three-Tier Architecture**: Built-in intent engine (zero setup) → Ollama (local LLM) → OpenAI/Anthropic (external LLM)
- **40+ Built-in Intents**: Inventory counts, VM power states, capacity metrics, error VMs, down hosts, networking (networks, subnets, routers, floating IPs), snapshot/drift/compliance summaries, user lists, role assignments, activity logs, runbook status, and full infrastructure overview — all powered by live SQL queries
- **Tenant / Project / Host Scoping**: Add "on tenant X", "for project X", or "on host Y" to any question for filtered results. Synonym expansion ensures natural phrasing always matches.
- **LLM Integration**: Free-form questions answered via Ollama (local, no data leaves your network) or OpenAI/Anthropic (with automatic sensitive data redaction)
- **Labeled FAB + Welcome Screen**: Prominent pill-shaped "🤖 Ask Copilot" button with pulse animation on first visit, welcome screen with examples, and a dedicated help view with 8 categorized question groups and usage tips
- **Admin Settings Panel**: Switch backends, configure URLs/keys/models, edit system prompts, test connectivity — all from the UI, no `.env` edits needed
- **Feedback & History**: Per-answer thumbs up/down, conversation history persisted per user with automatic trimming
- **Automatic Fallback**: If the LLM backend fails, seamlessly falls back to the built-in intent engine

### 🌐 Multi-Region & Multi-Cluster Support *(v1.73.0 → v1.79.0)*

**For MSPs managing multiple Platform9 customers or data centres, this is the operational core.**

A single pf9-mngt instance can connect to any number of Platform9 installations and OpenStack regions. Every view — inventory, metering, snapshots, reports, migration planner — automatically scopes to the selected region, or aggregates across all regions simultaneously.

**The MSP use case**: your company manages 4 customers, each on their own PF9 cluster. Without multi-cluster support you run 4 separate tools, correlate data manually, and switch contexts manually. With pf9-mngt you register all 4 control planes, and one console covers everything: per-customer inventory, per-customer chargeback, per-customer snapshot SLA, per-customer migration planning — with a region selector that switches context in one click.

#### Architecture
- **Two-level hierarchy** that mirrors OpenStack natively — one **control plane** per PF9 installation (one Keystone endpoint, shared identity), with one or more **regions** per control plane (each with its own Nova/Neutron/Cinder/Glance endpoints and independent resource inventory)
- **ClusterRegistry** replaces the legacy global `Pf9Client` singleton — the registry holds one authenticated client per region, manages sessions, and routes all API calls to the correct endpoint
- **Zero-migration rollout** — existing single-region deployments are automatically seeded on first startup; `PF9_AUTH_URL` + `PF9_REGION_NAME` become the `default` control plane and region; no operator action required

#### Management UI *(v1.76.0)*
- **Region Selector** — compact dropdown in the top nav bar, visible only when 2 or more regions are registered; groups options by control plane with live health-state colour dots (green / yellow / red / grey)
- **Cluster Management admin panel** — superadmin-only tab to add/delete/test control planes, discover and register regions with one click, enable/disable regions, trigger manual syncs, and view sync logs; no env-var changes or restarts required to add a new cluster

#### Per-Region Everything
- All infrastructure resources — VMs, volumes, networks, snapshots, provisioning jobs, search index, metering rows — carry a `region_id` FK; full per-region inventory, reporting, and audit trail
- All 7 API modules accept an optional `?region_id=` parameter to scope any query to a specific region, or aggregate across all regions when omitted
- **RBAC enforcement**: region-scoped users are automatically constrained to their assigned region (HTTP 403 on mismatch); global users may query any region
- All background workers (metering, snapshot, scheduler, search) run independent per-region loops — a slow or failed region does not block collection for healthy regions
- Redis cache keys are namespaced by `region_id` — no cross-region cache collisions

#### Cross-Region Migration Planning *(v1.77.0)*
- Migration projects can now be linked to registered regions via `target_region_id` — `pcd-gap-analysis` uses the ClusterRegistry client for live feasibility checks against that registered region, with full backward compatibility for ad-hoc credentials
- `GET /admin/control-planes/cluster-tasks` — superadmin endpoint exposing the `cluster_tasks` cross-region task bus; snapshot replication / DR failover deferred pending second-region testing infrastructure

#### Operational Resilience
- **Per-region health tracking**: `health_status` per region (`healthy` / `degraded` / `unreachable` / `auth_failed`), sync metrics, and last-sync timestamp
- **Per-region timeout**: each region call enforces a hard `asyncio.wait_for` deadline (`REGION_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SEC`, default 30 s) — an unreachable region cannot stall all others
- **SSRF protection**: each control plane has `allow_private_network` (default `false`) — blocks RFC-1918 and loopback outbound connections; configurable per-CP by superadmin for on-premises clusters

> 📖 See the dedicated **[Multi-Region & Multi-Cluster Guide](docs/MULTICLUSTER_GUIDE.md)** for a step-by-step operator walkthrough.

### �🎫 Support Ticket System *(v1.58 → v1.60)*
- **Full Ticket Lifecycle**: Ticket refs (TKT-YYYY-NNNNN); 5 types (incident, service_request, change_request, auto_incident, auto_change_request); full status/priority/type model; approval gate; SLA deadlines; OpenStack resource linkage
- **35+ API Endpoints** at `/api/tickets`: create, list, get, update, assign, escalate, approve/reject, resolve/reopen/close, comment thread, SLA policies, email templates, analytics, bulk actions
- **SLA Daemon**: Background asyncio task (15-min interval) — breach detection, Slack/Teams notification, auto-escalate on breach, activity comment logged
- **Auto-Ticket Triggers** *(v1.59)*: Critical/warning drift events → `auto_incident`; health score < 40 → `auto_incident`; graph delete intent → `auto_change_request` with `auto_blocked` gate; runbook failure → `auto_incident` linked to execution; migration wave complete → `service_request`
- **Ticket Analytics** *(v1.60)*: Resolution time by dept, SLA breach rate, top openers, daily volume trend; **LandingDashboard KPI tile** (Open / SLA Breached / Resolved Today / Opened Today)
- **Bulk Actions** *(v1.60)*: `close_stale`, `reassign`, `export_csv` via checkbox multi-select toolbar
- **Integration**: Trigger runbooks from a ticket and attach results; `email-customer` action via named HTML templates; inline ticket creation from Metering and Runbooks rows; team-member assignment at creation
- **5 DB Tables**: `support_tickets`, `ticket_comments`, `ticket_sla_policies`, `ticket_email_templates`, `ticket_sequence`; 17 seeded SLA policies, 6 HTML email templates
- **Navigation**: New "Operations & Support" group (🎫) with Tickets and My Queue items

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for complete platform)
- **Python 3.11+** with packages: `requests`, `openpyxl`, `psycopg2-binary`, `aiofiles`
- **Valid Platform9 credentials** (service account recommended) — *not required in Demo Mode*
- **Network access** to Platform9 cluster and compute nodes — *not required in Demo Mode*

### 1. Complete Automated Setup (Recommended)
```powershell
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/erezrozenbaum/pf9-mngt.git
cd pf9-mngt

# Configure environment (CRITICAL: No quotes around values)
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your Platform9 credentials

# One-command complete deployment
.\deployment.ps1

# What deployment.ps1 does:
# ✓ Checks/installs Docker Desktop
# ✓ Creates and validates .env configuration
# ✓ Creates required directories (logs, secrets, cache)
# ✓ Installs Python dependencies
# ✓ Builds and starts all Docker containers
# ✓ Initializes PostgreSQL database schema
# ✓ Configures LDAP directory structure
# ✓ Creates automated scheduled tasks
# ✓ Runs comprehensive health checks

# Alternative quick startup (assumes Docker installed)
.\startup.ps1

# Access services after deployment:
# UI:            http://localhost:5173
# API:           http://localhost:8000
# API Docs:      http://localhost:8000/docs
# Monitoring:    http://localhost:8001
# Database:      http://localhost:8080
```

### 1b. Demo Mode (No Platform9 Required)

Want to try the portal without a Platform9 environment? Demo mode populates the
database with realistic sample data (3 tenants, 35 VMs, 50+ volumes, snapshots,
drift events, compliance reports, etc.) and generates a static metrics cache.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/erezrozenbaum/pf9-mngt.git
cd pf9-mngt

# The deployment wizard will ask "Production or Demo?" — choose 2 for Demo
.\deployment.ps1

# Or enable demo mode manually on an existing install:
#   1. Set DEMO_MODE=true in .env
#   2. python seed_demo_data.py          # populates DB + generates metrics cache
#   3. docker-compose restart pf9_api    # API picks up DEMO_MODE env var
```

> In demo mode the UI shows an amber **DEMO** banner, the background metrics
> collector is skipped, and Platform9 credentials are not required.

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Platform9 Authentication
PF9_USERNAME=your-service-account@example.com
PF9_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
PF9_AUTH_URL=https://your-cluster.platform9.com/keystone/v3
PF9_USER_DOMAIN=Default
PF9_PROJECT_NAME=service
PF9_PROJECT_DOMAIN=Default
PF9_REGION_NAME=region-one

# Database
POSTGRES_USER=pf9
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=generate-secure-password-here
POSTGRES_DB=pf9_mgmt

# Monitoring
PF9_HOSTS=<HOST_IP_1>,<HOST_IP_2>,<HOST_IP_3>
METRICS_CACHE_TTL=60

# Production image version (docker-compose.prod.yml)
PF9_IMAGE_TAG=latest    # Pin to a release tag (e.g. v1.70.0) to lock images from ghcr.io
```

### 3. Manual Docker Setup
```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs pf9_api
```

### 4. Standalone Script Usage (No Docker Required)
```bash
# Inventory export
python pf9_rvtools.py

# Snapshot automation
python snapshots/p9_auto_snapshots.py --policy daily_5 --dry-run
python snapshots/p9_auto_snapshots.py --policy daily_5

# Compliance reporting
python snapshots/p9_snapshot_compliance_report.py --input latest_export.xlsx --output compliance.xlsx

# Policy assignment
python snapshots/p9_snapshot_policy_assign.py --config snapshots/snapshot_policy_rules.json --dry-run
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Snapshot Policies
```bash
# Daily snapshots with 5-day retention
openstack volume set --property auto_snapshot=true \
                    --property snapshot_policies=daily_5 \
                    --property retention_daily_5=5 \
                    <volume-id>

# Multiple policies on one volume
openstack volume set --property auto_snapshot=true \
                    --property snapshot_policies=daily_5,monthly_1st \
                    --property retention_daily_5=5 \
                    --property retention_monthly_1st=12 \
                    <volume-id>
```

### Scheduler Worker (v1.62.0+)
```powershell
# Check scheduler status
docker logs pf9_scheduler_worker --tail 30

# Trigger metrics collection manually
docker exec pf9_scheduler_worker python host_metrics_collector.py --once

# Trigger RVTools collection manually
docker exec pf9_scheduler_worker python pf9_rvtools.py
```
> Metrics collection and RVTools inventory now run inside the `pf9_scheduler_worker` container automatically.
> No Windows Task Scheduler setup is required.

---

## 🛠️ Administration

### Database
```bash
# Connect
psql -h localhost -U pf9 -d pf9_mgmt

# Manual backup
docker exec pf9_db pg_dump -U pf9 pf9_mgmt > backup.sql

# Restore
docker exec -i pf9_db psql -U pf9 pf9_mgmt < backup.sql
```

> For scheduled backups, use the 💾 Backup tab in the UI — the backup_worker runs pg_dump on a configurable schedule and writes compressed `.sql.gz` files.

### Service Management
```bash
docker-compose restart pf9_api
docker-compose up -d --scale pf9_api=2
docker stats
```

## �️ Project Status

**Current version:** [v1.82.12](CHANGELOG.md) — March 2026

**Development phase:** Production-hardened and ready for deployment. Full CI pipeline active (lint → unit tests → integration tests against a live Docker stack on every push). Docker images for all 9 services are automatically built and published to `ghcr.io` on every release. CORS restricted in production mode, database performance indexes applied automatically on startup.

**Platform:** Docker Compose with nginx TLS termination. All core containers (14) have restart policies and resource limits; a 15th `pf9_scheduler_worker` container handles automated collection, and `pf9_backup_worker` is added when `COMPOSE_PROFILES=backup` is set. Redis cache, rate limiting, and structured logging active.

**Maturity:** 15 of 17 tracked features are production-grade. AI Copilot is in beta. Kubernetes deployment is a planned future option.

---

## �🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Failed to fetch" in UI**
- Check API: `docker-compose logs pf9_api`
- Verify credentials in `.env`
- Test: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`

**Empty monitoring data**
- Check scheduler: `docker logs pf9_scheduler_worker --tail 20`
- Run once manually: `docker exec pf9_scheduler_worker python host_metrics_collector.py --once`
- Verify node_exporter on PF9 hosts (port 9388)

**Database connection errors**
- Check: `docker-compose logs db`
- Reset: `docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d`

**Authentication errors**
- Verify `.env` credentials and Platform9 URL
- Test: `curl -k https://your-cluster.com/keystone/v3`

**Monitoring not working after manual startup**
- Run: `.\fix_monitoring.ps1`

**Data synchronization issues**
- Force sync: `docker exec pf9_scheduler_worker python pf9_rvtools.py`
- Or run directly: `python pf9_rvtools.py`
- Check database via pgAdmin or CLI

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

**Environment file format — CRITICAL:**
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT
PF9_USERNAME=user@example.com

# ❌ WRONG
PF9_USERNAME="user@example.com"
```

**Security checklist for first-time setup:**
1. **NEVER commit `.env`** to version control
2. **Rotate credentials** if accidentally exposed
3. **Use service accounts**, not personal credentials
4. **Test with `--dry-run`** before production use

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>General</strong></summary>

**Q: Does this replace the Platform9 UI?**
A: No. It is a complementary engineering console that adds operational capabilities not present in the native Platform9 UI — automated snapshot scheduling, SLA compliance, restore workflows, chargeback, and more.

**Q: Is this an official Platform9 product?**
A: No. This is an independent project built to work with Platform9 OpenStack APIs. It is not endorsed by or affiliated with Platform9 Systems, Inc.

**Q: Can I run this on Kubernetes?**
A: Yes — fully supported since v1.82.0. A complete Helm chart ships in `k8s/helm/pf9-mngt/`. See [docs/KUBERNETES_GUIDE.md](docs/KUBERNETES_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions.

**Q: What are the minimum hardware requirements?**
A: A Docker host with at least 4 GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, and network access to your Platform9 region endpoints.

**Q: Can I try this without a Platform9 environment?**
A: Yes! Set `DEMO_MODE=true` in your `.env` (or choose **Demo** during `deployment.ps1`) and run `python seed_demo_data.py`. The database will be populated with realistic sample data and a static metrics cache so every dashboard, report, and workflow is fully functional without a live cluster.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Authentication & RBAC</strong></summary>

**Q: How does authentication work?**
A: Users authenticate against an LDAP directory (bundled OpenLDAP or your corporate LDAP/AD). JWT tokens are issued on login and validated on every API call. Optional TOTP-based MFA is supported.

**Q: What can each role do?**
A: `viewer` — read-only. `operator` — read + limited write. `admin` — full admin except user management. `superadmin` — full access including destructive operations. `technical` — read + write, no delete.

**Q: Can I use Active Directory instead of OpenLDAP?**
A: Yes. Set `LDAP_URL`, `LDAP_BASE_DN`, `LDAP_BIND_DN`, and `LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD` to point at your AD server.

**Q: How do I create the first admin user?**
A: The deployment script seeds a default admin via `admin_user.ldif`. After first login, use the Users tab to promote additional LDAP users. See [docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.md](docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Snapshots & Restore</strong></summary>

**Q: How does automated snapshot scheduling work?**
A: The snapshot scheduler evaluates policy rules, matches volumes by tenant/naming pattern/metadata, and creates snapshots via the Cinder API using a dedicated service user.

**Q: What is the Snapshot Service User?**
A: A dedicated Platform9 user automatically granted admin roles in each tenant project for cross-tenant snapshot creation. See [docs/SNAPSHOT_SERVICE_USER.md](docs/SNAPSHOT_SERVICE_USER.md).

**Q: What is the VM Provisioning Service User (`provisionsrv`)?**
A: A native Keystone service account (NOT in LDAP — invisible to tenant UIs) used by Runbook 2 (VM Provisioning) to create volumes and VMs with a properly project-scoped token. Without it, Nova/Cinder/Neutron resources would be created in the `service` project instead of the target tenant. Configure via `PROVISION_SERVICE_USER_EMAIL` and `PROVISION_USER_PASSWORD_ENCRYPTED`. Run `docker exec pf9_api python3 /app/setup_provision_user.py` once after initial deployment.

**Q: Is restore destructive?**
A: No. Side-by-side restore creates a new VM and a new volume. The original is untouched. Replace mode (superadmin-only) does delete the original and requires typed confirmation.

**Q: What is dry-run mode?**
A: When `RESTORE_DRY_RUN=true` (the default), the restore planner validates the full plan but does not execute it. Set to `false` to enable actual execution.

**Q: Can I cancel a restore in progress?**
A: Yes. Use the Cancel button or call `POST /api/restore/{job_id}/cancel`. The executor stops at the next step boundary and cleans up partial resources.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Monitoring & UI</strong></summary>

**Q: What does the Monitoring tab show?**
A: Real-time host-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk) collected from Platform9 hypervisors via Prometheus node_exporter.

**Q: What do the 🔧 tab icons mean?**
A: Write-capable tabs — they can create, modify, or delete resources. Read-only tabs use default styling.

**Q: Does the UI support dark mode?**
A: Yes. Click the theme toggle (top-right moon/sun icon). Your preference is saved in local storage.

**Q: Where are the logs?**
A: Application logs are in `logs/` and available via the System Logs tab (admin-only). Container logs via `docker logs <container>`.

**Q: How do I access the API documentation?**
A: Swagger docs at `http://<host>:8000/docs`, ReDoc at `http://<host>:8000/redoc`.

## 🎯 Recent Updates

### v1.82.12 — Fix Change Management / Customer Onboarding 500 (recorded_at)
- Fixed `v_recent_changes`: added `recorded_at` column (`COALESCE(modified_at, created_at, deleted_at)`)
- All `/history/daily-summary`, change-velocity, and audit queries now work correctly
- Added `migrate_fix_recent_changes_view.sql` for existing cluster patching

### v1.82.11 — Fix Change Management View (recorded_at)
- Fixed `v_most_changed_resources`: `v_recent_changes` has no `recorded_at` column — replaced with `COALESCE(modified_at, created_at, deleted_at)`
- Added `migrate_fix_most_changed_view.sql` to apply fix to existing databases
- Change Management UI page now loads correctly (was returning 500)

### v1.82.10 — Migration Ordering & Missing Table Fixes
- Restored deleted `migrate_00_migration_planner.sql` (core migration tables)
- Guarded `target_confirmed` column ref in `migrate_cohort_fixes.sql`
- Guarded `vm_provisioning_batches` ALTER in `migrate_multicluster.sql`
- Fixed Docker prod 502: UI nginx upstream port 80→8080

### v1.82.9 — Migration Runner Rewrite (psql + tracking table)

- **`run_migration.py`** — Rewritten to use `psql -f` subprocess per migration file, eliminating the `;`-split bug that shattered `DO $$ BEGIN...END $$` PL/pgSQL blocks. Adds a `schema_migrations` tracking table — each file runs exactly once, every deploy is idempotent.
- **`api/Dockerfile`** — Added `postgresql-client` so `psql` is available in the API container and the `db-migrate` Kubernetes Job.

### v1.82.8 — Scheduler RVTools Defaults Fix

- **`k8s/helm/pf9-mngt/values.yaml`** — Scheduler worker had wrong default env vars that silently prevented RVTools inventory from running in Kubernetes. `rvtoolsIntervalMinutes` was `"0"` (daily-only mode) and `rvtoolsRunOnStart` was `"false"`. Both Helm values override the `.env` file in-cluster. Fixed to `"60"` and `"true"` respectively — inventory now runs on pod start and every 60 minutes.

### v1.82.7 — Kubernetes API Routing + Admin Role Fixes

- **Helm `ingress.yaml`** — Ingress now routes all FastAPI paths (`/dashboard/`, `/os-distribution`, `/domains`, `/tenants`, `/snapshots`, `/servers`, etc.) to the API using an nginx regex rule, mirroring `nginx.prod.conf` exactly. Previously these went to the UI nginx returning HTML, causing `SyntaxError` in the dashboard.
- **Helm `ingress.yaml`** — Added `/metrics/.*` → monitoring service routing.
- **`api/auth.py`** — `initialize_default_admin()` now always force-sets the admin role to `superadmin` on startup, fixing the case where a stale `viewer` role row prevented admin access.

### v1.82.6 — Kubernetes Production Login Fixes

- **`api/main.py`** — `DEFAULT_ADMIN_USER` bypass account now skips MFA check entirely; a missing `user_mfa` table (fresh cluster) was causing a 503 "MFA service unavailable" error even with the correct password.
- **Helm `api/deployment.yaml`** — Added `APP_ENV`, `PF9_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (derived from `ingress.host`), and `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (from `pf9-admin-credentials` Secret); login was blocked by "Invalid host header" 400 and missing admin password.
- **Helm `ingress.yaml`** — TLS/cert-manager block guarded so chart renders correctly when `ingress.host` is empty.

### v1.82.5 — Kubernetes Probe Host Header Fix

- **Helm `api/deployment.yaml`** — Added `httpHeaders: [{name: Host, value: localhost}]` to `httpGet` liveness and readiness probes. Kubernetes sends the pod IP as the `Host` header; `TrustedHostMiddleware` was rejecting it with 400, causing a restart loop. Probes now pass a trusted hostname.

### v1.82.4 — CI Health-Check Fix (Named Volume Permissions)

- **`api/Dockerfile`** — Named Docker volume `app_logs` was root-owned because `/app/logs` didn't exist in the image. `logging.FileHandler` runs at import time and failed with `PermissionError`, crashing gunicorn before the health endpoint could respond. Fixed by adding `RUN mkdir -p /app/logs /app/static` before the `chown` step.

### v1.82.3 — API + UI Non-Root Permission Fixes

- **`api/Dockerfile`** — pod runs as UID 1000 but `/app` was owned by root; `PermissionError: '/app/static'` on every startup. Added `RUN chown -R 1000:1000 /app` + `USER 1000` after all `COPY` steps.
- **`pf9-ui/Dockerfile.prod`** — nginx `listen 80` requires root; changed to `listen 8080` + `EXPOSE 8080`.
- **Helm UI templates** — `containerPort`, probe ports, `targetPort`, and `ui.service.port` were all `5173` (Vite dev server); updated to `8080`.

### v1.82.2 — Kubernetes Deployment Fixes

- **`api/Dockerfile`** — `run_migration.py` and all `db/migrate_*.sql` files were missing from the API image; the `db-migrate` Job was failing immediately with `FileNotFoundError`. Fixed by adding `COPY run_migration.py ./` and a `RUN` step that concatenates all migration SQL files into `/app/run_migration_sql.sql` at build time.
- **`ldap-sync-worker`** — injected `LDAP_SYNC_KEY` env var from the `pf9-ldap-secrets` secret; worker was exiting immediately on startup without it.
- **`api` deployment** — injected `LDAP_SYNC_KEY` env var for LDAP federation decrypt path.
- **`ui` deployment** — added `emptyDir` volumes for `/var/cache/nginx` and `/var/run`; nginx running as non-root (UID 1000) cannot create these directories.
- **`scheduler-worker`** — added `emptyDir` volume at `/app/monitoring`; `host_metrics_collector.py` writes a cache file to a relative path unavailable in the container filesystem.

### v1.82.1 — CI Pipeline Fix

- **`update-values` job** — fixed `actions/checkout@v4` failure (`Error: Input required and not supplied: token`) when `RELEASE_PAT` secret is not configured; job now falls back to `github.token` automatically, making the release pipeline zero-config on first run.

### v1.82.0 — Kubernetes Production Support (Helm + ArgoCD + CI/CD)

- **Helm chart** — complete `k8s/helm/pf9-mngt/` chart covering all 14 services: API (Deployment), UI (Deployment), PostgreSQL (StatefulSet), Redis, OpenLDAP (StatefulSet), Monitoring, and all seven background workers (`backup`, `ldap-sync`, `metering`, `notification`, `scheduler`, `search`, `snapshot`)
- **ArgoCD GitOps** — `k8s/argocd/application.yaml` bootstrap manifest; ArgoCD auto-syncs on every `master` push that touches `k8s/helm/`
- **Helm pre-upgrade DB migration hook** — `templates/jobs/db-migrate.yaml` runs `run_migration.py` before each `helm upgrade` so schema is always current before the API rolls out
- **Ingress template** — nginx-ingress + cert-manager TLS; routes `/api`, `/auth`, `/health` to the API and `/` to the UI; domain and issuer configurable via `values.yaml`
- **CI Helm jobs** — two new jobs in `release.yml`: `helm-package` (packages + pushes the chart to GHCR OCI registry) and `update-values` (auto-updates `values.prod.yaml` image tags and commits `[skip ci]` back to `master` for ArgoCD to pick up)
- **Sealed Secrets guide** — `k8s/sealed-secrets/README.md` with copy-paste `kubeseal` commands for all nine Kubernetes Secrets the chart needs
- **Security posture** — all secret values pulled from named Kubernetes Secrets via `secretKeyRef` (never baked into `values.yaml`); LDAP service exposed as headless ClusterIP only (never reachable from outside the cluster); all pods run as non-root (`runAsUser: 1000`)

### v1.81.0 — Security Hardening & Kubernetes Pre-Requisites

- **Production JWT guard** — API now crashes at startup (instead of silently generating an ephemeral key) when `PRODUCTION_MODE=true` and no `JWT_SECRET_KEY` / `jwt_secret` Docker secret is configured
- **SSRF re-validation** in external LDAP auth passthrough — `_bind_external_ldap()` re-checks the host against RFC-1918 / loopback / ULA ranges at connection time (defence-in-depth)
- **Hardcoded database password defaults removed** — `backup_worker`, `metering_worker`, and `search_worker` now use the same `_read_secret()` helper pattern as `ldap_sync_worker`; the `"pf9pass"` fallback is gone
- **Worker liveness heartbeats** — all five long-lived workers (`backup`, `metering`, `search`, `scheduler`, `notification`) now touch `/tmp/alive` on every loop; matching `healthcheck` blocks added to `docker-compose.yml`
- **Backup config column allowlist** — `PUT /api/backup/config` validates column names against an explicit set before building the `UPDATE` query
- **`_plans/KUBERNETES_PLAN.md`** — full Kubernetes production roadmap (Helm chart, ArgoCD GitOps, Sealed Secrets, CI/CD additions, HPA plan)

### v1.80.0 — External LDAP Sync UI

- **`LdapSyncSettings` component** — full management UI under Admin → User Management → External LDAP Sync (superadmin-only); covers all backend fields across five sections (connection, service account, user search, group mappings, schedule)
- **Test / Preview / Logs panels** — inline detail pane per config; 🔌 test shows connect+bind results and sample users; 👁 preview shows dry-run create/update/deactivate counts; 📋 logs panel shows last 20 sync runs with expandable error details
- **docs/LDAP_SYNC_GUIDE.md** — comprehensive operator guide (requirements, step-by-step config, group mapping, TLS, testing, manual sync, logs, MFA delegation, security architecture, troubleshooting)

### v1.79.0 — External LDAP / AD Identity Federation

- **External LDAP / AD sync** — configure one or more external LDAP or Active Directory sources; the `ldap_sync_worker` periodically imports users and applies group-to-role mappings automatically
- **Credential passthrough** — externally-synced users authenticate with their origin LDAP password (no local copy stored); `auth.py` transparently binds to the source directory on login
- **Group-to-role mapping** — map external LDAP groups to pf9-mngt roles (`viewer`, `operator`, `admin`, `technical`); `superadmin` cannot be assigned via sync by design
- **CRUD config API** — 10 new superadmin-only endpoints: create/update/delete configs, test connectivity, dry-run preview, manual sync trigger, paginated sync logs
- **SSRF protection** — host validation blocks RFC-1918, loopback, link-local, and ULA targets before any LDAP connection is opened
- **Fernet encryption** — bind passwords encrypted at rest with a dedicated `ldap_sync_key` Docker secret; shared `crypto_helper.py` utility used by both LDAP sync and cluster registry
- **Session revocation** — when a synced user is deactivated or removed from all mapped groups, their active sessions are invalidated immediately
- **`db/migrate_ldap_sync.sql`** — idempotent migration adds 3 new tables + 3 `user_roles` columns

### v1.78.0 — Security & Auth Hardening

- **LDAP DN injection closed** — `ldap.dn.escape_dn_chars()` applied to all 4 DN-construction sites in `auth.py`; a crafted username can no longer rewrite the LDAP bind target
- **LDAP network timeout** — `OPT_NETWORK_TIMEOUT = 5 s` added to all 7 `ldap.initialize()` call sites; hung LDAP connections no longer stall gunicorn worker threads
- **`verify_admin_credentials` hardened** — unconfigured password now raises HTTP 503 (was silently bypassing auth); credential comparison uses `hmac.compare_digest()` to prevent timing attacks
- **`datetime.utcnow()` replaced** — all auth JWT/session code now uses `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`; removes deprecation warnings on Python 3.12+
- **Middleware token cache** — `rbac_middleware` stores `TokenData` in `request.state`; `access_log_middleware` reads it instead of re-calling `verify_token()`, removing one DB round-trip per request
- **`SMTP_PASSWORD` via Docker secrets** — `smtp_helper.py` now resolves the SMTP password through `read_secret()` (checks `/run/secrets/smtp_password` first, falls back to env var), consistent with every other credential in the project

### v1.77.0 — Migration Planner Region Normalization

- **`migration_projects.target_region_id`** — new FK column to `pf9_regions`; `pcd-gap-analysis` now uses the ClusterRegistry client when a registered region is linked to a project (no more global config mutation)
- **`migration_projects.source_region_id`** — new FK column for cross-region migration tracking; nullable, NULL for VMware-to-PCD migrations
- **`GET /admin/control-planes/cluster-tasks`** — new superadmin endpoint exposing pending cluster_tasks rows with `processor_status: NOT_IMPLEMENTED`
- **`db/migrate_phase8_migration_norm.sql`** — adds both FK columns + selective indexes + `idx_cluster_tasks_pending`
- Full backward compatibility: projects without `target_region_id` continue using ad-hoc `pcd_auth_url` credentials

### v1.76.0 — Multi-Region Management UI

- **Region selector** in top nav bar — compact dropdown that appears only when ≥ 2 regions are registered; groups options by control plane with health-state indicators
- **Cluster Management panel** — new superadmin-only tab for managing control planes and regions (add/delete/test CPs; register/enable/sync regions)
- **Per-region filtering** in MeteringTab, ResourceManagementTab, ReportsTab, and LandingDashboard — all views now pass `?region_id=` when a region is selected
- **`ClusterContext`** React context provides shared state to the entire authenticated shell
- **`migrate_phase7_nav.sql`** — adds `cluster_management` nav item to the admin tools group

### v1.75.0 — Multi-Region API Filtering

- **Optional `?region_id=` on all API modules** — metering, dashboards, reports, resource management, provisioning, VM provisioning, and search endpoints all accept a `?region_id=` query parameter to scope results to a specific PF9 region
- **RBAC region enforcement** — `get_effective_region_filter()` in `auth.py`: region-scoped users are automatically constrained to their assigned region (HTTP 403 if they request another); global users may query any region
- **Live-API routing** — when `region_id` is specified, all PF9 API calls route to the correct region registry client
- **DB-query filtering** — all DB-backed endpoints apply `WHERE region_id = %s` with the effective region when specified
- **`search_ranked` updated** — backward-compatible 9th parameter `filter_region` added to PostgreSQL function; `search_documents.region_id` column + index added via `migrate_phase6_api.sql`
- **Startup migration guard** — `main.py` applies `migrate_phase6_api.sql` idempotently on restart

### v1.74.6 — Metering Worker Crash Fix

- **Hardened Phase 5B migration guard** — guard now verifies all six target tables have `region_id` before skipping `migrate_metering_region.sql`; a partial prior run (e.g. from CI) no longer causes a false-positive skip that leaves 4 tables unpatched
- **`security_groups.region_id` column added** — `init.sql` and `migrate_multicluster.sql` now include `security_groups` in the infra `region_id` sweep; fixes metering_worker crash on `collect_quota_usage` LATERAL subquery

### v1.74.5 — Multi-Region Worker Support

- **metering_worker**: Full multi-region loop — each enabled region gets its own metering collection cycle with `region_id`-tagged rows in all metering tables. `collect_resource_metrics` passes `region_id` to the monitoring API; `collect_snapshot_metrics` and `collect_quota_usage` filter inventory tables by region. `run_collection_cycle` now iterates all regions and writes a `cluster_sync_metrics` row per region.
- **HostMetricsCollector**: Constructor accepts optional `region_id` argument for explicit region binding.
- **scheduler_worker**: `metrics_loop` now creates one `HostMetricsCollector` per region, writes `cluster_sync_metrics` after each collection, and falls back to single-region env-var mode when no region rows exist.
- **p9_snapshot_policy_assign**: `--region-id` now properly scopes all progress output; `region_label` prefixes every print line for clear multi-region log attribution.
- **backup_worker**: `backup_history` rows now carry `region_id` tracking metadata for manual region-triggered backup jobs.
- **DB migration** (`migrate_metering_region.sql`): adds `region_id TEXT` column and indexes to all metering tables and `backup_history`.

### v1.74.4 — Search Worker VM Indexing Fix
- ✅ **VM search indexing restored** — `LEFT JOIN images` used `i.image_id` (non-existent column); corrected to `i.id` in `search_worker/main.py` and `api/reports.py`; VM records now index correctly every 5 minutes and OS info appears in reports

### v1.74.3 — Blank-UI-on-Restart Fixes
- ✅ **DDL lock storm eliminated** — `api/main.py` now checks whether `pf9_regions` / `snapshot_runs.region_id` already exist before issuing any `ALTER TABLE`; zero `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` locks on healthy restarts → pages load instantly after `startup_prod.ps1`
- ✅ **Snapshot worker crash loop fixed** — corrected indentation bug that placed a recursive `main()` call inside the function body, causing exit code 0 with empty logs; `next_compliance_report` counter now advances correctly; 10 s sleep added to scheduler loop
- ✅ **PostgreSQL idle-in-transaction protection** — `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout=30s` + `statement_timeout=2min` added to DB service; stale transactions that block DDL are auto-terminated on restart

### v1.74.2 — Multi-Region Worker Support
- ✅ **Thread-safe endpoint storage** — `p9_common.py` uses `threading.local` for per-thread endpoint variables; safe for concurrent region processing
- ✅ **Scheduler multi-region loop** — `scheduler_worker` queries enabled regions from DB and runs RVTools sync for each region concurrently, bounded by `MAX_PARALLEL_REGIONS`
- ✅ **Metering sync tracking** — `metering_worker` records per-cycle stats (resource count, errors, duration) to `cluster_sync_metrics` after each collection cycle
- ✅ **Snapshot region tagging** — snapshot scheduler delegates to sub-scripts with per-region credentials; `snapshot_runs` and `snapshot_records` gain `region_id` column
- ✅ **Host metrics DB-sourced hosts** — `host_metrics_collector` loads hypervisor IPs from DB when `PF9_REGION_ID` is set, replacing static `PF9_HOSTS` env var
- ✅ **SQL migration parser fix** — semicolons in `--` comment lines in `migrate_multicluster.sql` were fragmenting `CREATE TABLE pf9_regions`; fixed, multi-cluster schema now applies correctly on startup

### v1.74.1 — SAST Security Fixes & CI Gate Correction
- ✅ **Bandit CI gate fixed** — HIGH-severity gate flags corrected from `-ll -ii` (Medium+) to `-lll -iii` (HIGH only); was causing 259 Medium issues to block every push
- ✅ **Bandit HIGH findings resolved** — `hashlib.sha1` (LDAP SSHA), `hashlib.md5` (cache keys, change fingerprinting), and `requests verify=False` (internal PF9 endpoint) annotated with `usedforsecurity=False` / `nosec`; all four B324 and B501 HIGH/HIGH findings cleared
- ✅ **Zero HIGH findings** — `bandit -lll -iii` scans clean: `No issues identified.`

### v1.74.0 — Control Plane & Region Management API
- ✅ **REST API for multi-cluster admin** — 14 new superadmin-only endpoints under `/admin/control-planes` for full CRUD on control planes and regions; no DB restarts or psql commands needed
- ✅ **Fernet credential encryption** — passwords for additional control planes are encrypted with Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) derived from `JWT_SECRET`; prefix `fernet:<ciphertext>` stored in `password_enc`; plaintext never written to DB
- ✅ **Live connectivity test** — `POST /admin/control-planes/{id}/test` authenticates against Keystone and returns discovered regions and service catalog endpoints
- ✅ **SSRF protection enforced** — `auth_url` validated on write: loopback and 169.254.169.254 always blocked; HTTP blocked unless `ALLOW_HTTP_AUTH_URL=true`; RFC-1918 private IPs allowed for on-premises deployments when `allow_private_network=true`
- ✅ **Superadmin-only guard** — all control-plane and region management operations require `superadmin` role; full audit log entries written on every create/update/delete
- ✅ **Registry hot-reload** — in-memory `ClusterRegistry` is reloaded after every write; running workers pick up new regions without restart
- ✅ **Bandit SAST job** — CI pipeline extended with a high-severity security gate using Bandit; HIGH findings block merge, MEDIUM findings are reported but non-blocking
- ✅ **25 new unit tests** — SSRF validation, Fernet roundtrip, `superadmin` role guard, password never returned in responses, router registration

### v1.73.3 — Security Patch (npm)
- ✅ **GHSA-rf6f-7fwh-wjgh resolved** — `flatted` override bumped to `>=3.4.2`; patches Prototype Pollution (high severity) in transitive UI dependency
- ✅ **GHSA-2g4f-4pwh-qvx6 resolved** — `ajv` override added at `>=6.14.0`; patches ReDoS via `$data` option (moderate severity)

### v1.73.2 — Security Patch
- ✅ **CVE-2026-30922 resolved** — `pyasn1>=0.6.3` pinned in `api/requirements.txt`; patches uncontrolled recursion / DoS vulnerability in the ASN.1 decoder (transitive dependency of `paramiko`, `python-jose`, `python-ldap`)

### v1.73.1 — ClusterRegistry + Multi-Region Client Hub
- ✅ **ClusterRegistry module** — new `api/cluster_registry.py`; synchronous, thread-safe two-level registry (control planes → regions) replaces the global `get_client()` singleton; all 100+ existing callers are unchanged
- ✅ **Auto-initializes from DB** — loads `pf9_control_planes` / `pf9_regions` on startup; falls back to env vars if DB empty so existing single-region installs need no changes
- ✅ **MultiClusterQuery** — parallel fan-out across all enabled regions with `asyncio + run_in_executor`; concurrency cap (`MAX_PARALLEL_REGIONS`, default 3); per-region hard timeout (`REGION_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SEC`, default 30 s) prevents slow regions from blocking the others
- ✅ **Clean shutdown** — `ClusterRegistry.shutdown()` closes every `requests.Session` on app exit; no dangling connections
- ✅ **22 unit tests** — full coverage with no live DB or Platform9 instance required

### v1.73.0 — Multi-Region & Multi-Cluster Support
- ✅ **Control plane registry** — `pf9_control_planes` table: register multiple Platform9 installations (distinct Keystone endpoints) with independent service-account credentials
- ✅ **Region registry** — `pf9_regions` table: two-level model matching OpenStack's architecture; per-region health tracking (`healthy` / `degraded` / `unreachable` / `auth_failed`), sync metrics, and failover priority
- ✅ **Auto-seeded on first start** — existing deployments are automatically migrated; current `PF9_AUTH_URL` + `PF9_REGION_NAME` become the `default` control plane/region with no operator action
- ✅ **Cross-region task engine** — `cluster_tasks` state machine for snapshot replication, DR failover, and cross-region migration; workers use `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to prevent double-execution
- ✅ **Region-scoped resources** — `region_id` FK added to all infrastructure tables (VMs, volumes, networks, snapshots, provisioning jobs, etc.)
- ✅ **Service catalog region bug fixed** — `_find_endpoint()` now correctly filters by `region_id`; prevents silent wrong-region API calls in multi-region control planes
- ✅ **Cache key namespacing** — Redis keys include `region_id`; prevents cross-region cache collisions on shared Redis instances

### v1.72.5 — System Metadata Routing Fix
- ✅ `/system-metadata-summary` and `/export` endpoints added to `nginx.prod.conf`, `nginx.conf`, and the Vite dev proxy — fixes System Metadata tab showing empty under Inventory

### v1.72.0 — Migration Planner Restored & Production Startup Fixes
- ✅ **Migration Planner restored** — `migration_routes.py`, `migration_engine.py`, and all frontend components re-added after being removed in v1.69.0; committed and included in CI-built images
- ✅ **`startup_prod.ps1` fixed** — replaced `--build` with `docker compose pull` + `docker compose up -d`; was silently overwriting pulled `ghcr.io` images with local source
- ✅ **nginx `/tenants` routing fixed** — `GET /tenants` alias added to resolve Migration Planner 404

### v1.71.0 — Dependency Security Patches & Quality Fixes
- ✅ **Python dependency CVEs** — `fastapi`, `requests`, `python-ldap`, `python-jose`, `python-multipart` upgraded (13 CVEs resolved)
- ✅ **npm CVE overrides** — `flatted`, `minimatch`, `rollup` forced to patched versions
- ✅ **CSV export quoting** — `QUOTE_ALL` prevents column corruption on fields with commas/newlines

### v1.68.0–v1.70.0 — Security Hardening, Bug Fixes & Performance
- ✅ **XSS fix** — OpsSearch `ts_headline` sanitized via DOMPurify; SMTP TLS certificate enforcement
- ✅ **LDAP fixes** — `create_user()` stores `{SSHA}` hashed passwords; backup uses `-y <tempfile>` (no plaintext in `ps aux`)
- ✅ **Report pagination** — `tenant-quota-usage` and `domain-overview` paged before per-project API calls; upload row cap (2,000) prevents memory exhaustion
- ✅ **Dependency vulnerability scanning in CI** — `pip-audit` + `npm audit` gating integration tests
