pf9-mngt is an open-source operational add-on for Platform9 / OpenStack — it gives engineering and MSP teams automated snapshots, VM restore, full inventory persistence, and day-to-day monitoring in a single self-hosted stack.

---

## 🧭 Why This Exists — An Engineering Evaluation Story

The conversation around VMware alternatives is real and growing. For MSPs and enterprise teams evaluating their options, Platform9 on OpenStack is genuinely worth looking at. Solid technology, strong business model, and a credible path for organizations managing private and hybrid cloud at scale.

We are currently in the evaluation phase — testing Platform9 as a potential direction for our infrastructure. During that process, like any serious evaluation, you go beyond the demo and start stress-testing real operational workflows. That is where engineering gaps become visible — not because the platform is lacking, but because MSP and enterprise operations have very specific day-to-day requirements that take time for any platform to fully mature into.

Rather than pause the evaluation, we chose to solve the gaps ourselves and reach a better, more informed decision point. The result is pf9-mngt. Building it has given us far deeper insight into the platform than any standard assessment would have. Whatever direction we ultimately choose, this process has been worth it.

This entire project was built using AI as a genuine engineering partner — what some call vibe coding, but applied to a real production problem with real architectural decisions. One person, clear intent, and the right AI workflow can ship something with genuine depth. That is worth demonstrating.

### 🔐 Engineering Gap 1 — Metadata Ownership & Operational Resilience

OpenStack identifies everything by UUID. Resource names, relationships, network topology, and tenant context all live in the metadata layer on the management cluster. When you run Platform9 in SaaS mode, that metadata lives on their platform — not yours.

From an engineering perspective this creates a real operational resilience challenge. Without that metadata layer your resources become very difficult to identify and manage independently at scale. For MSPs managing multiple tenants and hundreds of resources, this is a genuine business continuity risk.

**The engineering answer:** pf9-mngt continuously pulls and persists all infrastructure metadata into a local PostgreSQL database that you own and control — independently of the platform. Resource names, relationships, tenant context, change history, and full inventory are always available locally, regardless of platform availability. This is exactly what RVTools does for VMware environments. We built the equivalent for Platform9 and OpenStack.

---

### ⚡ Engineering Gap 2 — VM Restore

In VMware, restoring a VM is a right-click. In OpenStack, there is no equivalent native workflow. To recover a VM from a snapshot you must manually reconstruct everything — remember the original flavor, network topology, IP configuration, re-attach the snapshot volume, and preserve user credentials. All of this under SLA pressure, without making a mistake.

For an MSP, that manual process is not sustainable at scale. It is exactly the kind of procedure that goes wrong at the worst possible moment.

**The engineering answer:** pf9-mngt automates the entire restore procedure. The restore engine handles flavor, network topology, IP addresses, user credentials, and volume attachment automatically. Two restore modes are supported:

- **Side-by-side restore** — a new VM with a new name and new IP spins up alongside the original, completely non-destructively. Validate before cutover. Nothing is touched until you are ready.
- **Replace restore** — full automated recovery with the original configuration restored. Superadmin-only for safety.

Every restore operation is fully audited — who triggered it, what was restored, what mode, duration, and outcome. For MSP accountability and compliance this is not optional.

---

### 🔄 Engineering Gap 3 — Snapshot Automation & Compliance

There is no native automated snapshot scheduler in Platform9 or OpenStack. No configurable per-volume policies. No retention management. No SLA compliance tracking. For an MSP, snapshot automation is table stakes — you cannot deliver a managed service without it.

**The engineering answer:** pf9-mngt includes a complete snapshot automation engine built from scratch. Configurable policies per volume — daily, monthly, custom retention — with automatic cleanup and full SLA compliance reporting aggregated by tenant and domain. v1.26.0 adds **quota-aware batching** with Cinder quota pre-checks, tenant-grouped batching with configurable rate limits, live progress tracking, and the `snapshot_quota_forecast` proactive runbook.

---

### 📦 Engineering Gap 4 — VMware Migration Assessment & Capacity Planning

Migrating hundreds of VMs from VMware to PCD is not just "move the disks." You need full source inventory analysis, OS compatibility classification, warm-vs-cold mode determination, per-VM time estimation, cohort planning, and target capacity validation — before a single VM moves. No native tooling ties RVTools data to PCD readiness in one end-to-end workflow.

**The engineering answer:** pf9-mngt includes a full **Migration Planner** — a multi-stage workflow that takes you from raw RVTools data all the way to an approved, wave-sequenced migration plan ready for execution.

**📥 Source Inventory & Assessment**
- RVTools XLSX ingestion — parses vInfo, vPartition, vDisk, vNetwork sheets into a structured per-VM inventory
- Per-VM risk scoring (GREEN / YELLOW / RED) with configurable weighted rules (OS, disk size, NIC count, snapshots)
- Warm-eligible vs cold-required classification — based on risk score and operator overrides
- OS family and version detection; actual used-disk data from vPartition (not provisioned size)
- Per-VM time estimation — warm phase-1 copy, incremental sync, cutover window, and cold total downtime
- Excel + PDF export — Project Summary, Per-Tenant Assessment, Daily Schedule, All VMs

**🗺️ Target Mapping & Capacity Planning**
- Per-tenant scoping — mark tenants in or out of plan with bulk-select toolbar and exclusion reasons
- Source → PCD target mapping — map each tenant to a target PCD domain and project; auto-seeded with confirmed-flag review workflow
- Source → PCD network mapping — auto-seeded from VM inventory; VLAN ID, confirmed status, Find & Replace, Confirm All
- VM dependency annotation — mark app-stack ordering constraints (web → DB) with circular-dependency validation
- Per-tenant readiness checks — 5 auto-derived: target mapped, network mapped, quota sufficient, no critical gaps, VMs classified
- Overcommit profile modeling — Aggressive / Balanced / Conservative presets with configurable ratios
- Quota requirements engine — recommended per-tenant vCPU, RAM, and storage on the PCD side
- **Performance-based node sizing** — uses actual `cpu_usage_percent` / `memory_usage_percent` from RVTools data (not vCPU allocation ÷ overcommit) for accurate physical node demand; falls back to allocation or quota if performance data is unavailable
- Auto-detect PCD node profile from live hypervisor inventory with one click
- PCD readiness gap analysis — missing flavors, networks, images, unmapped tenants — with severity scoring and downloadable action report (Excel + PDF)

**🗃️ Cohort Planning**
- **Migration Cohorts** — split large projects into ordered workstreams, each with its own schedule, owner, and dependency gate
- **Tenant ease scoring** — composite 0–100 score per tenant based on VM count, disk size, risk score, OS support rate, network complexity, and cross-tenant dependencies; configurable dimension weights
- **Auto-assign strategies** — six algorithms: easiest-first, riskiest-last, pilot + bulk, balanced load, OS-first, by-priority; with guardrails (max VMs, max disk, max avg risk per cohort)
- **What-if estimator** — two side-by-side models per cohort (bandwidth/transfer model + VM-slots scheduler model); live recalculation as you adjust agent slots or bandwidth; project deadline banner turns red if either model exceeds the target duration
- Expandable cohort cards — avg ease, risk distribution, OS mix, readiness counts, and cross-cohort dependency warnings
- Gantt-style date bars and dependency lock indicators

**🌊 Wave Planning**
- Cohort-scoped auto-builder — builds independent wave sets per cohort in execution order; five strategies: bandwidth-paced, risk-tiered, even-spread, dependency-ordered, pilot-first
- Pilot wave support — auto-creates a low-risk pilot wave per cohort to validate toolchain before committing the bulk
- Full wave lifecycle — planned → confirmed → in-progress → complete, with timestamps and transition guards
- Per-wave pre-flight checklists — network mapped, target project set, VMs assessed, no critical gaps, agent reachable, snapshot baseline
- Wave Planner UI — VM migration funnel, per-cohort wave cards, VM assignment tables, preflight status panel, dry-run preview before committing

### �🐳 Deployment Flexibility — You Decide How to Run This

pf9-mngt is currently developed on Windows using Docker containers. That is the development environment — but the architecture is deliberately not prescriptive about how you run it in production.

Every service is containerized. That means **you decide**:

| Option | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| 🐳 **Docker Compose** | Simple, fast, perfectly viable for many teams |
| ☸️ **Kubernetes** | Production-grade HA and horizontal scaling — containers are ready, effort is minimal |
| 🔧 **Your own orchestration** | Adapt to whatever infrastructure decisions you have already made |

> See [docs/KUBERNETES_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](docs/KUBERNETES_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for migration planning.  
> See [docs/LINUX_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/LINUX_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for running on Linux.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for complete platform)
- **Python 3.11+** with packages: `requests`, `openpyxl`, `psycopg2-binary`, `aiohttp`, `aiofiles`
- **Valid Platform9 credentials** (service account recommended) — *not required in Demo Mode*
- **Network access** to Platform9 cluster and compute nodes — *not required in Demo Mode*

### 1. Complete Automated Setup (Recommended)
```powershell
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/erezrozenbaum/pf9-mngt.git
cd pf9-mngt

# Configure environment (CRITICAL: No quotes around values)
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your Platform9 credentials

# One-command complete deployment
.\deployment.ps1

# What deployment.ps1 does:
# ✓ Checks/installs Docker Desktop
# ✓ Creates and validates .env configuration
# ✓ Creates required directories (logs, secrets, cache)
# ✓ Installs Python dependencies
# ✓ Builds and starts all Docker containers
# ✓ Initializes PostgreSQL database schema
# ✓ Configures LDAP directory structure
# ✓ Creates automated scheduled tasks
# ✓ Runs comprehensive health checks

# Alternative quick startup (assumes Docker installed)
.\startup.ps1

# Access services after deployment:
# UI:            http://localhost:5173
# API:           http://localhost:8000
# API Docs:      http://localhost:8000/docs
# Monitoring:    http://localhost:8001
# Database:      http://localhost:8080
```

### 1b. Demo Mode (No Platform9 Required)

Want to try the portal without a Platform9 environment? Demo mode populates the
database with realistic sample data (3 tenants, 35 VMs, 50+ volumes, snapshots,
drift events, compliance reports, etc.) and generates a static metrics cache.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/erezrozenbaum/pf9-mngt.git
cd pf9-mngt

# The deployment wizard will ask "Production or Demo?" — choose 2 for Demo
.\deployment.ps1

# Or enable demo mode manually on an existing install:
#   1. Set DEMO_MODE=true in .env
#   2. python seed_demo_data.py          # populates DB + generates metrics cache
#   3. docker-compose restart pf9_api    # API picks up DEMO_MODE env var
```

> In demo mode the UI shows an amber **DEMO** banner, the background metrics
> collector is skipped, and Platform9 credentials are not required.

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Platform9 Authentication
PF9_USERNAME=your-service-account@company.com
PF9_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
PF9_AUTH_URL=https://your-cluster.platform9.com/keystone/v3

```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Snapshot Policies
```bash
# Daily snapshots with 5-day retention
openstack volume set --property auto_snapshot=true \
                    --property snapshot_policies=daily_5 \
                    --property retention_daily_5=5 \
                    <volume-id>

# Multiple policies on one volume
openstack volume set --property auto_snapshot=true \
                    --property snapshot_policies=daily_5,monthly_1st \
                    --property retention_daily_5=5 \
                    --property retention_monthly_1st=12 \
                    <volume-id>
```

### Windows Task Scheduler
```powershell
# Metrics collection (auto-created by startup.ps1)
# Every 30 minutes — "PF9 Metrics Collection"

## 🛠️ Administration

### Database
```bash
# Connect
psql -h localhost -U pf9 -d pf9_mgmt

# Manual backup
docker exec pf9_db pg_dump -U pf9 pf9_mgmt > backup.sql

# Restore
docker exec -i pf9_db psql -U pf9 pf9_mgmt < backup.sql
```

> For scheduled backups, use the 💾 Backup tab in the UI — the backup_worker runs pg_dump on a configurable schedule and writes compressed `.sql.gz` files.

### Service Management
```bash
docker-compose restart pf9_api
docker-compose up -d --scale pf9_api=2
docker stats
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Failed to fetch" in UI**
- Check API: `docker-compose logs pf9_api`
- Verify credentials in `.env`
- Test: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`

**Empty monitoring data**
- Run: `python host_metrics_collector.py --once`
- Check task: `schtasks /query /tn "PF9 Metrics Collection"`
- Verify node_exporter on PF9 hosts (port 9388)

**Database connection errors**
- Check: `docker-compose logs db`
- Reset: `docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d`

**Authentication errors**
- Verify `.env` credentials and Platform9 URL
- Test: `curl -k https://your-cluster.com/keystone/v3`

**Monitoring not working after manual startup**
- Run: `.\fix_monitoring.ps1`

**Data synchronization issues**
- Force sync: `python pf9_rvtools.py`
- Check database via pgAdmin or CLI

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

**Environment file format — CRITICAL:**
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT
PF9_USERNAME=user@company.com

# ❌ WRONG
PF9_USERNAME="user@company.com"
```

**Security checklist for first-time setup:**
1. **NEVER commit `.env`** to version control
2. **Rotate credentials** if accidentally exposed
3. **Use service accounts**, not personal credentials
4. **Test with `--dry-run`** before production use

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>General</strong></summary>

**Q: Does this replace the Platform9 UI?**
A: No. It is a complementary engineering console that adds operational capabilities not present in the native Platform9 UI — automated snapshot scheduling, SLA compliance, restore workflows, chargeback, and more.

**Q: Is this an official Platform9 product?**
A: No. This is an independent project built to work with Platform9 OpenStack APIs. It is not endorsed by or affiliated with Platform9 Systems, Inc.

**Q: Can I run this on Kubernetes?**
A: Yes. Every service is containerized. See [docs/KUBERNETES_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](docs/KUBERNETES_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

**Q: What are the minimum hardware requirements?**
A: A Docker host with at least 4 GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, and network access to your Platform9 region endpoints.

**Q: Can I try this without a Platform9 environment?**
A: Yes! Set `DEMO_MODE=true` in your `.env` (or choose **Demo** during `deployment.ps1`) and run `python seed_demo_data.py`. The database will be populated with realistic sample data and a static metrics cache so every dashboard, report, and workflow is fully functional without a live cluster.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Authentication & RBAC</strong></summary>

**Q: How does authentication work?**
A: Users authenticate against an LDAP directory (bundled OpenLDAP or your corporate LDAP/AD). JWT tokens are issued on login and validated on every API call. Optional TOTP-based MFA is supported.

**Q: What can each role do?**
A: `viewer` — read-only. `operator` — read + limited write. `admin` — full admin except user management. `superadmin` — full access including destructive operations. `technical` — read + write, no delete.

**Q: Can I use Active Directory instead of OpenLDAP?**
A: Yes. Set `LDAP_URL`, `LDAP_BASE_DN`, `LDAP_BIND_DN`, and `LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD` to point at your AD server.

**Q: How do I create the first admin user?**
A: The deployment script seeds a default admin via `admin_user.ldif`. After first login, use the Users tab to promote additional LDAP users. See [docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.md](docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Snapshots & Restore</strong></summary>

**Q: How does automated snapshot scheduling work?**
A: The snapshot scheduler evaluates policy rules, matches volumes by tenant/naming pattern/metadata, and creates snapshots via the Cinder API using a dedicated service user.

**Q: What is the Snapshot Service User?**
A: A dedicated Platform9 user automatically granted admin roles in each tenant project for cross-tenant snapshot creation. See [docs/SNAPSHOT_SERVICE_USER.md](docs/SNAPSHOT_SERVICE_USER.md).

**Q: Is restore destructive?**
A: No. Side-by-side restore creates a new VM and a new volume. The original is untouched. Replace mode (superadmin-only) does delete the original and requires typed confirmation.

**Q: What is dry-run mode?**
A: When `RESTORE_DRY_RUN=true` (the default), the restore planner validates the full plan but does not execute it. Set to `false` to enable actual execution.

**Q: Can I cancel a restore in progress?**
A: Yes. Use the Cancel button or call `POST /api/restore/{job_id}/cancel`. The executor stops at the next step boundary and cleans up partial resources.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Monitoring & UI</strong></summary>

**Q: What does the Monitoring tab show?**
A: Real-time host-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk) collected from Platform9 hypervisors via Prometheus node_exporter.

**Q: What do the 🔧 tab icons mean?**
A: Write-capable tabs — they can create, modify, or delete resources. Read-only tabs use default styling.

**Q: Does the UI support dark mode?**
A: Yes. Click the theme toggle (top-right moon/sun icon). Your preference is saved in local storage.

**Q: Where are the logs?**
A: Application logs are in `logs/` and available via the System Logs tab (admin-only). Container logs via `docker logs <container>`.

**Q: How do I access the API documentation?**
A: Swagger docs at `http://<host>:8000/docs`, ReDoc at `http://<host>:8000/redoc`.

## 🎯 Recent Updates

### v1.34.1 — Wave Planner Bug Fixes
- ✅ **Cohort-scoped iteration** — `auto_build_waves` now calls `build_wave_plan()` per cohort in `cohort_order` sequence; each cohort builds its own independent wave set
- ✅ **`cohort_order` column** — SQL query fixed from `"order"` to `cohort_order`
- ✅ **Wave naming** — Waves use cohort name as prefix; pilot wave `🧪 <Cohort>`, regular waves numbered from 1 per cohort
- ✅ **`risk_category` column** — Fixed all SQL queries referencing the wrong column name `risk_classification`
- ✅ **`vm_name` NOT NULL** — Wave VM INSERT now resolves vm_name from `vm_name_map` lookup before inserting
- ✅ **`RealDictCursor` scalar fetch** — Plain cursor used for scalar queries; no more `fetchone()[0]` TypeError on dicts
- ✅ **Pydantic v2 compatibility** — All `user.get()` calls replaced with `getattr(user, "username", "?")`
- ✅ **Double emoji badge** — Removed hardcoded `📦` prefix; cohort badge now uses `wave.cohort_name` directly

### v1.34.0 — Phase 3: Wave Planning (Complete)
- ✅ **Cohort-scoped wave building** — VMs assigned to waves per cohort independently, respecting cohort ordering
- ✅ **5 scheduling strategies** — bandwidth-paced, risk-tiered, even-spread, dependency-ordered, pilot-first

- ✅ **Two-model What-If** — Side-by-side comparison of bandwidth/schedule scenarios per cohort
- ✅ **Execution plan view** — Calendar-style wave schedule with per-day VM count and cumulative progress
- ✅ **Cohort dependency gates** — Block cohort start until predecessor cohort reaches defined completion threshold

### v1.32.0–v1.32.1 — Smart Cohort Planning
- ✅ **Auto-assign VMs to cohorts** — Intelligent assignment based on tenant priority, risk score, and VM size
- ✅ **Ease scores** — Per-VM migration ease scoring combining risk, disk size, OS family, and dependency count
- ✅ **Ramp profile mode** — Conservative/standard/aggressive ramp controls for wave capacity curve
- ✅ **Cohort health dashboard** — Per-cohort readiness summary with blocking issue count and completion estimate

### v1.31.0–v1.31.1 — Migration Cohorts & Network Mapping (Phase 2.10)
- ✅ **Migration Cohorts** — Split large projects into ordered workstreams with independent schedules, owners, and dependency gates
- ✅ **Source → PCD Network Mapping** — Auto-seeded from VM inventory with best-guess target name and amber ⚠️ confirmed-flag review pattern

- ✅ **Target name pre-seeding fix** (v1.31.1) — Both `migration_network_mappings` and `migration_tenants` auto-seed target fields with `confirmed` flag; readiness checks return `pending` until reviewed

### v1.28.3 — Migration Plan Excel/PDF Export + Parser Fixes
- ✅ **Excel Export** — `Export Excel` button downloads a 4-sheet openpyxl workbook: Project Summary, Per-Tenant Assessment (colour-coded), Daily Schedule, All VMs with full timing columns
- ✅ **PDF Export** — `Export PDF` button downloads a landscape A4 PDF (reportlab) with all three sections and a page footer
- ✅ **vCPU usage % fixed** — RVTools vCPU sheet uses `overall` (MHz) + `cpus`; parser now computes `cpu_usage_percent = min(demand / (cpus × 2400 MHz) × 100, 100)`
- ✅ **vMemory usage % fixed** — RVTools vMemory sheet uses `consumed` + `size mib`; parser now computes correct memory %; all 448 VMs have valid values
- ✅ **Phase1 times fixed** — `estimate_vm_time()` was multiplying data by 3–8% instead of applying 45–65% bandwidth utilization; fixed to show realistic 3 min–1.5 h range

### v1.30.1 — Performance-Based Node Sizing
- ✅ **Actual VM utilisation for sizing** — Node sizing now uses `cpu_usage_percent`/`memory_usage_percent` per VM (from RVtools data) instead of configured vCPU ÷ overcommit. For the PoC cluster: 125 vCPU actually running vs 1,371 allocated — result is +2 new nodes needed, not +9
- ✅ **Three-tier basis** — Prefers actual performance data (when ≥50% coverage), falls back to allocation ÷ overcommit, then tenant quota
- ✅ **Sizing basis badge** — Capacity tab shows green/amber pill identifying whether sizing was based on real utilisation or allocation estimate, with coverage %, actual vCPU/RAM, and allocated vCPU/RAM

### v1.30.0 — Pre-Phase 3 Polish (Phase 2.8)
- ✅ **Auto-Detect PCD node profile** — "🔍 Auto-Detect from PCD" button pre-fills node spec from dominant hypervisor type in inventory; no manual spec entry needed
- ✅ **Gap Analysis Action Report** — Excel (3 sheets: Executive Summary, Action Items, All Gaps) + PDF export from PCD Readiness tab
- ✅ **Plan export auth fix** — Excel/PDF plan export was failing without auth token; replaced `<a>` navigation with `downloadAuthBlob()` helper

- ✅ **Migration Schedule section** — Duration, working hours/day, working days/week, target VMs/day
- ✅ **Schedule-aware agent sizing** — Recommends agent count based on project timeline + throughput need
- ✅ **Cluster-based tenant detection** — New `cluster` method as fallback for non-vCD environments
- ✅ **Inline tenant editing** — Edit tenant name and OrgVDC inline; cascade to all VMs

### v1.28.0 — Migration Intelligence & Execution Cockpit (Phase 1)
- ✅ **Migration Planner tab** — 15 new DB tables, full lifecycle (draft → archived), RVTools XLSX import with 6-sheet parsing
- ✅ **Risk scoring engine** — Configurable 0–100 score (GREEN/YELLOW/RED) with weighted OS, disk, snapshot, NIC factors

### v1.26.0 — Snapshot Quota-Aware Batching & Forecast Runbook
- ✅ **Quota Pre-Check** — Cinder quota checked before snapshotting; volumes that would exceed GB/snapshot limits are flagged `quota_blocked` instead of failing with 413 errors
- ✅ **Tenant-Grouped Batching** — Volumes batched by tenant with configurable `--batch-size` (default 20) and `--batch-delay` (default 5s) to avoid API rate limiting at scale (500+ tenants)
- ✅ **Live Progress Tracking** — Real-time progress bar in Snapshot Monitor with batch indicators, estimated completion, and active polling (`GET /snapshot/runs/active/progress`)
