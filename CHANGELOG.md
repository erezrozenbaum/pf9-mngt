## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **History tab — deletion record viewing** — clicking "View Details" on a deletion record now queries `deletions_history` and shows the deletion event timeline, original resource type, reason, last-seen timestamp, and raw state snapshot; previously returned HTTP 500 "Invalid resource type: deletion"
- **History tab — advanced filtering** — filter recent changes by resource type, project, domain, and free-text search (matches name, ID, or description); "Clear Filters" button appears when any filter is active; count shows "X of Y" when filtered
- **History tab — sortable columns** — click Time, Type, Resource, Project, Domain, or Change Description headers to sort ascending/descending with ▲/▼ indicators
- **Dashboard — data freshness banner** — prominent banner at the top of the Landing Dashboard showing when the last inventory collection ran, how long it took, and a color-coded age indicator (green = fresh < 1h, yellow = 1–2h, red = stale > 2h); helps users understand how current the displayed data is

### Enhanced
- **Dashboard — last-run API uses database** — `/dashboard/rvtools-last-run` endpoint now queries the `inventory_runs` table (source of truth) instead of searching for Excel files on disk which didn't exist in the container; returns timestamp, source, duration, and run ID
- **Snapshot Compliance Report** — major UI and API improvements
  - Volumes grouped by policy with collapsible sections and per-policy compliance percentage
  - API queries volumes table directly (source of truth) instead of stale compliance_details
  - Removed duplicate `/snapshot/compliance` endpoint from main.py that served stale data
  - Full name resolution: volume → `volumes.name`, project → `projects.name`, tenant → `domains.name`, VM → `servers.name`
  - Each volume × policy is a separate row (e.g. 11 volumes × 3 policies = 33 rows)
  - Retention days per policy from volume metadata (`retention_daily_5`, `retention_monthly_1st`, etc.)
  - Snapshot count and last-snapshot timestamp are now strictly per-policy (joins `snapshot_records` with `snapshots` on `snapshot_id`)
  - Policies that haven't run yet (e.g. `monthly_1st` before the 1st) correctly show 0 snapshots and "—" for last snapshot
  - Non-compliant rows highlighted with subtle red background
  - Added CSV export button with all compliance data including snapshot count
  - Tenant/Project filter dropdowns send IDs (not names) for proper server-side filtering
  - Compliance report generator (`p9_snapshot_compliance_report.py`) now writes per-policy rows with resolved names
  - **Sortable column headers** per policy group table (click to sort asc/desc on any column)
  - **Volume ID and VM ID columns** added to compliance table for unique identification
  - **Per-policy snapshot counts from OpenStack metadata** — queries `snapshots.raw_json->'metadata'` directly (`created_by`, `policy`) instead of unreliable `snapshot_records` JOIN
  - **Separate Manual Snapshots section** — manual (non-automated) snapshots shown in their own table below compliance, with snapshot name/ID, volume, project, tenant, size, status, and created date; clear note that manual snapshots are never touched by automation
  - **Pending status for unscheduled policies** — policies that have never run (e.g. `monthly_15th`, `monthly_1st`) now show "Pending" (grey badge) instead of "Missing" (red), and are excluded from the non-compliant count; summary cards show Compliant / Non-Compliant / Pending separately

### Fixed
- **Snapshot Compliance showed NaN, missing names, and no per-policy breakdown**
  - Root cause: duplicate endpoint in `main.py` read from stale `compliance_details` table
  - Compliance_details had concatenated policy names, literal "NaN" for unnamed volumes, no tenant/VM data
  - Fixed by removing duplicate and querying volumes table with JOINs to projects, domains, servers
- **`SnapshotPolicySetCreate` model missing `tenant_name` field** — the create endpoint wrote `tenant_name` to the DB but the Pydantic model lacked the field, causing runtime errors
- **Compliance report showed wrong snapshot counts and last-snapshot for monthly policies**
  - Snapshot count was volume-level (all policies combined) instead of per-policy — `daily_5` could show 8 snapshots even with retention=5
  - Last-snapshot timestamp fell back to volume-level (any policy), so `monthly_15th`/`monthly_1st` showed the `daily_5` timestamp instead of "—"
  - Fixed by querying `snapshots.raw_json->'metadata'` directly for `created_by=p9_auto_snapshots` and `policy=<name>`, eliminating dependency on incomplete `snapshot_records` table
- **Snapshot retention off-by-one: count = retention + 1 after each cycle**
  - Root cause: `cleanup_old_snapshots_for_volume()` ran BEFORE creating the new snapshot, so it trimmed to `retention` then a new one was added → `retention + 1`
  - Fixed by moving cleanup to AFTER the snapshot is created in `process_volume()`, so the new snapshot is included in the count and the oldest excess one is deleted
- **Daily dedup: prevent duplicate snapshots on same-day reruns**
  - Running `p9_auto_snapshots.py` multiple times in one day would create multiple snapshots consuming retention slots, reducing the actual days of recovery coverage
  - Added `_has_snapshot_today()` check — before creating, verifies no snapshot with matching `created_by` + `policy` metadata exists for the current UTC date; if one exists the volume is skipped with status `SKIPPED`
  - `daily_5` now guarantees exactly 1 snapshot per day per volume, keeping 5 calendar days of recovery points
- **History tab "View History" error for deletion records**
  - Clicking "View History" on a deletion record returned HTTP 500: `Invalid resource type: deletion`
  - Root cause: `v_comprehensive_changes` emits `resource_type='deletion'` but the `/history/resource/{type}/{id}` endpoint's `table_mapping` only contained standard resource types
  - Fixed by adding dedicated `deletion` handling in all three history endpoints (`/history/resource`, `/history/compare`, `/history/details`) — queries `deletions_history` directly and returns standardized history format with original resource type, reason, and raw state snapshot
