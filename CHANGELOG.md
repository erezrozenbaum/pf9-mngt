## [Unreleased]

### Enhanced
- **Snapshot Compliance Report** — major UI and API improvements
  - Volumes grouped by policy with collapsible sections and per-policy compliance percentage
  - API queries volumes table directly (source of truth) instead of stale compliance_details
  - Removed duplicate `/snapshot/compliance` endpoint from main.py that served stale data
  - Full name resolution: volume → `volumes.name`, project → `projects.name`, tenant → `domains.name`, VM → `servers.name`
  - Each volume × policy is a separate row (e.g. 11 volumes × 3 policies = 33 rows)
  - Retention days per policy from volume metadata (`retention_daily_5`, `retention_monthly_1st`, etc.)
  - Non-compliant rows highlighted with subtle red background
  - Added CSV export button with all compliance data
  - Tenant/Project filter dropdowns send IDs (not names) for proper server-side filtering
  - Compliance report generator (`p9_snapshot_compliance_report.py`) now writes per-policy rows with resolved names

### Fixed
- **Snapshot Compliance showed NaN, missing names, and no per-policy breakdown**
  - Root cause: duplicate endpoint in `main.py` read from stale `compliance_details` table
  - Compliance_details had concatenated policy names, literal "NaN" for unnamed volumes, no tenant/VM data
  - Fixed by removing duplicate and querying volumes table with JOINs to projects, domains, servers

### Security
- Removed all customer-specific data from git-tracked files
  - No hardcoded domain names, passwords, IPs, or encryption keys in source
  - All sensitive values read from environment variables (`.env` file)
  - `.env` properly gitignored; `.env.example` provides template
- LDAP admin password passed via environment variable (not hardcoded)
- Snapshot service user password supports Fernet encryption at rest
- JWT secret auto-generated during deployment
