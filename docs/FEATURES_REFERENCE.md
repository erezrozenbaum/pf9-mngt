# Features Reference — Technical Deep Dive (v2.10)

> **v2.10.0 NEW**: Shared internal library — `secret_helper`, `crypto_helper`, and `request_helpers` extracted from `api/` and `tenant_portal/` into a new `shared/` package (repo root). Single source of truth; both Dockerfiles updated; backward-compatible re-export wrappers. No API or schema changes.
> **v2.9.0 NEW**: Closed-Loop Event Automation — `clea_policies` table maps operational event types to runbooks with `auto` or `single_approval` modes; event bus evaluates policies after every event write; CRUD API (`/api/admin/clea/policies`), execution log with approve/reject endpoints, admin "⚡ Automation" UI tab under Admin Tools.
> **v2.8.0 NEW**: Schema consolidation — retired `_ensure_tables()` lazy DDL anti-pattern from all 7 API route modules; all tables now defined in `db/init.sql` + `db/migrate_*.sql`; `vm_provisioning_*`, `onboarding_*`, `migration_flavor_staging` tables added to init.sql for clean installs.
> **v2.7.0 NEW**: Event Bus (`emit_event()` fire-and-forget writer to `operational_events`); Platform Health endpoint (`GET /api/admin/platform/health` — DB latency, Redis ping, pool stats, worker last-run); Platform Health UI tab under Admin Tools.
> **v2.6.8 FIX**: Drift detection false positive on new-VM provisioning — `_detect_drift()` in `db_writer.py` now skips events where `old_value IS NULL`; first-time field assignments (e.g. boot volume `server_id: NULL → vm_uuid`) no longer generate drift events. Only genuine state changes between two known non-null values emit drift events.
> **v2.6.6 NEW**: Admin Right-Sizing Open Ticket button — each recommendation card in the admin Right-Sizing tab now has a 🎫 Open Ticket action; creates a support ticket via `/api/tickets/_auto` (`auto_source=admin_rightsizing`), routes to Tier3 Support, deduplicates on `rightsizing:{rec_id}`
> **v2.6.4 NEW/FIX**: Billing impact fields (`current_monthly_cost`, `recommended_monthly_cost`, `currency`) on all rightsizing recommendations; admin project dropdown filter; tenant Request Resize CTA (`POST /tenant/rightsizing/{id}/request-change`); `tenant_portal_role` granted `UPDATE ON rightsizing_recommendations` + `SELECT ON metering_flavor_pricing`
> **v2.6.3 FIX**: Metering worker API fallback unauthenticated (401) → `cpu_usage_percent = NULL` in all recent `metering_resources` rows → RightsizingEngine found 0 qualifying VMs; fixed by using `/internal/monitoring/vm-metrics` with `X-Internal-Secret`
> **v2.6.2 FIX**: Tenant portal Cost Optimisation 500 error (`inject_rls_vars` connection/cursor bug); Right-Sizing nav item seeded into DB navigation
> **v2.6.1 FIX**: RightsizingEngine — rollback shared DB connection on loader exceptions to prevent transaction abort cascade
> **v2.6.0 NEW**: Workload Right-Sizing & Cost Waste Detection — idle/over-provisioned VM classification, flavor recommendations, estimated monthly savings, admin + tenant UI surfaces
> **v1.95**: Advanced billing & metering system with enterprise tenant management
> Complete technical reference for all pf9-mngt features.

- **Stale Job Auto-Timeout**: Scheduler marks PLANNED jobs older than `RESTORE_PLANNED_TIMEOUT_H` hours (default 2) and RUNNING/PENDING jobs older than `RESTORE_RUNNING_TIMEOUT_H` hours (default 6) as FAILED — prevents orphaned jobs from remaining stuck indefinitely

### 👁️ Real-Time Monitoring
- **Host Metrics**: Live CPU, memory, storage from PF9 compute nodes via Prometheus node_exporter (port 9388)
- **VM Metrics**: Individual VM resource tracking via libvirt_exporter (port 9177)
- **K8s hostNetwork mode**: Monitoring pod runs with `hostNetwork: true` so it uses the K8s node IP (not pod-CIDR) for outbound connections; required when hypervisor firewalls permit only node-IP traffic — prevents storage/memory/network metrics from returning `None`
- **SSH + virsh fallback**: When `PF9_SSH_KEY_FILE` is configured, the monitoring service collects CPU/memory/storage/network metrics via `virsh domstats` over SSH when the libvirt-exporter is unreachable; OpenStack VM UUIDs extracted from block device paths for correlation
- **Automated Collection**: Background collection every 30 minutes
- **Persistent Cache**: Metrics survive service restarts
- **Integrated Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring tab with auto-refresh

### 🌐 Multi-Region & Multi-Cluster Support *(v1.73.0 → v1.79.0)*

**For MSPs managing multiple Platform9 customers or data centres, this is the operational core.**

A single pf9-mngt instance can connect to any number of Platform9 installations and OpenStack regions. Every view — inventory, metering, snapshots, reports, migration planner — automatically scopes to the selected region, or aggregates across all regions simultaneously.

**The MSP use case**: your company manages 4 customers, each on their own PF9 cluster. Without multi-cluster support you run 4 separate tools, correlate data manually, and switch contexts manually. With pf9-mngt you register all 4 control planes, and one console covers everything: per-customer inventory, per-customer chargeback, per-customer snapshot SLA, per-customer migration planning — with a region selector that switches context in one click.

#### Architecture
- **Two-level hierarchy** that mirrors OpenStack natively — one **control plane** per PF9 installation (one Keystone endpoint, shared identity), with one or more **regions** per control plane (each with its own Nova/Neutron/Cinder/Glance endpoints and independent resource inventory)
- **ClusterRegistry** replaces the legacy global `Pf9Client` singleton — the registry holds one authenticated client per region, manages sessions, and routes all API calls to the correct endpoint
- **Zero-migration rollout** — existing single-region deployments are automatically seeded on first startup; `PF9_AUTH_URL` + `PF9_REGION_NAME` become the `default` control plane and region; no operator action required

#### Management UI *(v1.76.0)*
- **Region Selector** — compact dropdown in the top nav bar, visible only when 2 or more regions are registered; groups options by control plane with live health-state colour dots (green / yellow / red / grey)
- **Cluster Management admin panel** — superadmin-only tab to add/delete/test control planes, discover and register regions with one click, enable/disable regions, trigger manual syncs, and view sync logs; no env-var changes or restarts required to add a new cluster

#### Per-Region Everything
- All infrastructure resources — VMs, volumes, networks, snapshots, provisioning jobs, search index, metering rows — carry a `region_id` FK; full per-region inventory, reporting, and audit trail
- All 7 API modules accept an optional `?region_id=` parameter to scope any query to a specific region, or aggregate across all regions when omitted
- **RBAC enforcement**: region-scoped users are automatically constrained to their assigned region (HTTP 403 on mismatch); global users may query any region
- All background workers (metering, snapshot, scheduler, search) run independent per-region loops — a slow or failed region does not block collection for healthy regions
- Redis cache keys are namespaced by `region_id` — no cross-region cache collisions

#### Cross-Region Migration Planning *(v1.77.0)*
- Migration projects can now be linked to registered regions via `target_region_id` — `pcd-gap-analysis` uses the ClusterRegistry client for live feasibility checks against that registered region, with full backward compatibility for ad-hoc credentials
- `GET /admin/control-planes/cluster-tasks` — superadmin endpoint exposing the `cluster_tasks` cross-region task bus; snapshot replication / DR failover deferred pending second-region testing infrastructure

#### Operational Resilience
- **Per-region health tracking**: `health_status` per region (`healthy` / `degraded` / `unreachable` / `auth_failed`), sync metrics, and last-sync timestamp
- **Per-region timeout**: each region call enforces a hard `asyncio.wait_for` deadline (`REGION_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SEC`, default 30 s) — an unreachable region cannot stall all others
- **SSRF protection**: each control plane has `allow_private_network` (default `false`) — blocks RFC-1918 and loopback outbound connections; configurable per-CP by superadmin for on-premises clusters
- **Circuit breaker state visibility** *(v2.5.0)*: `GET /admin/control-planes/{cp_id}/regions/{region_id}/sync-status` includes a `circuit_breaker` field exposing live state (`closed` / `open` / `half_open`), consecutive failure count, and seconds remaining until next probe attempt

> 📖 See the dedicated **[Multi-Region & Multi-Cluster Guide](docs/MULTICLUSTER_GUIDE.md)** for a step-by-step operator walkthrough.

### �🎫 Support Ticket System *(v1.58 → v1.60)*
- **Full Ticket Lifecycle**: Ticket refs (TKT-YYYY-NNNNN); 5 types (incident, service_request, change_request, auto_incident, auto_change_request); full status/priority/type model; approval gate; SLA deadlines; OpenStack resource linkage
- **35+ API Endpoints** at `/api/tickets`: create, list, get, update, assign, escalate, approve/reject, resolve/reopen/close, comment thread, SLA policies, email templates, analytics, bulk actions
- **SLA Daemon**: Background asyncio task (15-min interval) — breach detection, Slack/Teams notification, auto-escalate on breach, activity comment logged
- **Auto-Ticket Triggers** *(v1.59)*: Critical/warning drift events → `auto_incident`; health score < 40 → `auto_incident`; graph delete intent → `auto_change_request` with `auto_blocked` gate; runbook failure → `auto_incident` linked to execution; migration wave complete → `service_request`
- **Ticket Analytics** *(v1.60)*: Resolution time by dept, SLA breach rate, top openers, daily volume trend; **LandingDashboard KPI tile** (Open / SLA Breached / Resolved Today / Opened Today)

- **Navigation**: New "Operations & Support" group (🎫) with Tickets and My Queue items

### 📊 Operational Intelligence *(v1.86.0 → v1.92.0)*

**Continuous, background-running insight engine for MSP and enterprise infrastructure operators.**

The `intelligence_worker` runs 6 detection engines every 5 minutes and writes structured insights to `operational_insights`. Insights are categorised by department (operations, finance, general), severity (info/medium/high/critical), and type. Expired conditions auto-resolve.

- **Waste engine** *(v1.86.0)*: Detects idle VMs (powered off ≥7d, powered off ≥14d) and orphaned resources (unattached volumes, dangling FIPs, unused security groups).
- **Risk engine** *(v1.86.0)*: Detects critical health decline (score drops ≥20 pts in 7d) and snapshot gaps (VMs without snapshot coverage ≥7d). Auto-creates `auto_incident` tickets for critical findings.
- **SLA engine** *(v1.86.0)*: Detects imminent SLA breaches (≤48 h to deadline for open tickets). Monthly PDF report: `POST /api/sla/generate-report/{tenant_id}` — cover page, KPI scorecard, history table, attestation footer.
- **Capacity engine** *(v1.89.0)*: Per-hypervisor compute saturation forecast (`capacity_compute`), per-project quota saturation (`capacity_quota_*`), and storage quota pressure. All include `confidence` + `r_squared` metadata.
- **Cross-region + Anomaly engine** *(v1.89.0)*: Utilization imbalance, risk concentration, VM-count spikes, snapshot spikes, API error spikes.
- **Revenue Leakage engine** *(v1.90.0)*: `leakage_overconsumption` — tenant resources exceed contracted entitlement by ≥10% (medium at 10–25%, high at >25%). `leakage_ghost` — tenant has active resources but no contract row. Requires `msp_contract_entitlements` rows to be populated.

**QBR PDF Generator** *(v1.90.0)*: `POST /api/intelligence/qbr/generate/{tenant_id}` — configurable sections (cover, executive_summary, interventions, health_trend, open_items, methodology). Sections build from resolved insights × labor rates for defensible ROI reporting.

**PSA Outbound Webhook** *(v1.90.0)*: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/psa/configs`. Per-config filtering: min severity, insight types allow-list, region IDs allow-list. Auth header Fernet-encrypted at rest. Webhooks fire from the intelligence worker on new high/critical insights — no cross-service HTTP dependency.

**Intelligence Settings Panel** (admin-only, `⚙️ Settings` tab in InsightsTab): Labor rates editor (8 types, cost-per-hour), PSA Webhook CRUD with test-fire, Contract Entitlements CSV importer.

**Insights Feed UI** *(v1.86.0 → v1.91.0)*: Department workspace selector (operations, risk, capacity, general), severity badges, per-insight acknowledge/snooze/resolve, bulk actions, recommendation panel, per-insight recommendations with dismiss. Type filter optgroup: Waste, Risk, SLA, Capacity, Anomaly, Cross-Region, Revenue Leakage. Sort by: severity, detected, last seen, type, entity, tenant, status (7 options). Copilot intents: critical_insights, capacity_warnings, waste_insights, unacknowledged_insights_count, risk_summary, intelligence_waste_summary *(v1.93.47)*, capacity_forecast *(v1.93.47)*, intelligence_risk_summary *(v1.93.47)*, **timeline_what_changed, timeline_tenant, timeline_recent_hours** *(v1.96.7)*.

**Insights History tab** *(v1.91.0)*: “🕐 History” sub-tab in the Insights Dashboard showing resolved insights with detected/resolved timestamps, paginated at 50 per page.

**Operations workspace summary bar** *(v1.91.0)*: When the Operations workspace is selected, a summary bar above the feed shows total open, risk, waste, and leakage insight counts in colour-coded badges.

**Client Health endpoint** *(v1.91.0, fixed v1.93.12)*: `GET /api/intelligence/client-health/{tenant_id}` — Efficiency score (avg `metering_efficiency.overall_score` last 7 days + verbal classification), Stability score (100 minus severity-weighted open insights: critical −20, high −10, medium −5), Capacity Runway (days until soonest resource hits 90% quota, from `metering_quotas` linear regression). RBAC: `client_health:read` (viewer, operator, admin, superadmin). *v1.93.12: endpoint now resolves the project UUID to its human-readable name before querying `metering_efficiency`, fixing Efficiency always returning 0 when called with a project UUID.*

**Portfolio summary endpoint** *(v1.92.0)*: `GET /api/sla/portfolio/summary` — Per-tenant portfolio view for account managers. Returns a row per managed client with `sla_status` (healthy/at_risk/breached/not_configured), `contracted_vcpu`, `used_vcpu`, `contract_usage_pct`, `open_critical_count`, `open_total_count`, `leakage_insight_count`. RBAC: `sla:read`.

**Executive summary endpoint** *(v1.92.0)*: `GET /api/sla/portfolio/executive-summary` — Fleet-level aggregation: `total_clients`, `sla_healthy/at_risk/breached/not_configured`, `sla_health_pct`, `revenue_leakage_monthly` (null when no `unit_price` set), `leakage_client_count`, `open_critical_insights`, `avg_mttr_hours`, `avg_mttr_commitment_hours`.

New `account_manager` RBAC role; `Account Management` department with `default_nav_item_key = account_manager_dashboard` for persona auto-routing on login.

**Executive Dashboard** *(v1.92.0, `executive_dashboard` tab)*: Fleet-level stacked SLA health bar, 6 KPI cards (Fleet Health %, Breached, At Risk, Open Critical, Revenue Leakage/Month, Avg MTTR), and narrative sections for leakage and MTTR compliance. New `executive` RBAC role; `Executive Leadership` department with `default_nav_item_key = executive_dashboard`.

### 📋 Operational Event Timeline *(v1.96.0 → v1.96.8)*

**A unified, chronological audit trail of all infrastructure events — harvested automatically from 10 source tables, visible to admins and (domain-scoped) to tenants.**

**Database foundation** *(v1.96.0)*: `operational_events` table — `id`, `event_time`, `domain_id`, `domain_name`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `category`, `severity`, `source`, `title`, `description`, `actor`, `metadata`. `timeline_harvest_cursors` table tracks per-source incremental position. `Timeline` nav item seeded under Intelligence Views; RBAC permissions for all roles.

**REST API** *(v1.96.1)*: `GET /api/timeline` (paginated list with filters: entity, domain/project, region, category, severity, time range), `GET /api/timeline/blast-radius` (events ±N minutes around a timestamp), `GET /api/timeline/stats` (by-category/severity counts). Role-based visibility filters apply.

**Event Harvester** *(v1.96.2, fixed v1.96.6)*: `intelligence_worker` `TimelineHarvester` engine runs every cycle, pulling from `activity_log`, `operational_insights`, `support_tickets`, `backup_history`, `snapshot_records`, `sla_compliance_monthly`, `runbook_executions`, `metering_efficiency`, `metering_quotas`, `auth_audit_log`. Cursor-based incremental ingestion. Automatic retention pruning (`TIMELINE_RETENTION_DAYS`, default 180). *v1.96.5.1: all harvester queries now resolve `domain_id` via JOINs — insights via project membership, provisioning via batch records, tickets via project FK, auth via user lookup, metering via project name.*

**Admin UI** *(v1.96.3)*: `Timeline` tab in Intelligence Views. Three modes: **Tenant** (full event chain for a selected domain), **Resource** (events for a specific entity type + ID), **Global** (cross-region feed). Filter bar: time range, severity, category chips (11 categories). Vertical timeline newest-first with severity badges, entity chips, expand-to-detail.

**Contextual navigation hooks** *(v1.96.4)*: Dependency graph nodes, insight rows, and ticket detail panels can deep-link into the Timeline pre-filtered to the relevant resource or time window.

**Tenant portal Event History** *(v1.96.5, fixed v1.96.6)*: "⏱ Event History" screen in `tenant-ui`. Domain-scoped — server-side enforced. `GET /tenant/timeline` + `GET /tenant/timeline/stats` endpoints in the tenant portal service. *v1.96.5.1: `tenant_portal_role` granted `SELECT` on `operational_events`; API route and React component field-name mismatches corrected (`title`/`source`/`actor`/`description`).*

**Copilot integration** *(v1.96.7, fixed v1.96.8)*: Three built-in Copilot intents added to `copilot_intents.py`: `timeline_what_changed`, `timeline_tenant`, `timeline_recent_hours`. `build_infra_context()` injects last 5 warning/critical events into every LLM system prompt. New "Event Timeline" suggestion chip category. *v1.96.8: column name corrected to `occurred_at`.* Full guide: [OPERATIONAL_TIMELINE_GUIDE.md](OPERATIONAL_TIMELINE_GUIDE.md).

### 🏢 Tenant Self-Service Portal *(v1.84.0+, latest v1.92.0)*

**For MSPs and operators who want to give customers limited, secure access to their own infrastructure — with self-service VM provisioning, security group management, and read-only observer access — without exposing the admin panel.**

A separate FastAPI service on port 8010 (`tenant_portal/`) provides a JWT-isolated, MFA-protected API and accompanying React SPA (`tenant-ui/`) per customer. Tenants can monitor their VMs, browse snapshots, initiate restores, manage security groups, view a dependency graph, provision new VMs, and inspect their health scores — all scoped to their own projects only.

- **Observer role** *(v1.91.0)*: `portal_role` column on `tenant_portal_access` (`manager` | `observer`). Observer JWT tokens are blocked at the FastAPI dependency layer (`require_manager_role()`) from all 8 write routes. Role persists through TOTP/email-OTP MFA flows, is embedded as a JWT claim, and is toggleable per-user from the admin UI without disrupting the session.
- **Observer invite flow** *(v1.91.0)*: `POST /api/intelligence/invite-observer` generates a one-time `portal_invite_tokens` row and sends a branded HTML email with a magic-link. Tokens expire and are one-time-use enforced by `used_at`.
- **Health Overview screen** *(v1.91.0, fixed v1.93.12)*: New default landing screen in `tenant-ui` with three SVG circular progress dials (Efficiency, Stability, Capacity Runway) sourced from `GET /tenant/client-health` — a proxy to the admin API `client-health` endpoint. *v1.93.12: Capacity Runway dial now shows a neutral grey ring when no quota ceiling is configured (was showing a misleading red "0"); Efficiency score bug fixed (was always 0 due to UUID→name mismatch in the upstream query).*
- **Event History (Operational Timeline)** *(v1.96.5, fixed v1.96.6)*: "⏱ Event History" screen in `tenant-ui` giving tenants a read-only, domain-scoped chronological view of operational events for their environment. Time range picker (2h/6h/24h/7d/30d), 7 category filter chips (Monitoring, Provisioning, Snapshot, Backup, SLA, Ticket, Intelligence), severity filter, and free-text search on event title. All events are server-side filtered to the authenticated tenant's domain — cross-tenant access is not possible. Backed by `GET /tenant/timeline` (paginated) and `GET /tenant/timeline/stats` (by-category/severity counts). *v1.96.5.1: harvester now correctly populates `domain_id` for all event sources; `tenant_portal_role` granted `SELECT` on `operational_events`; field-name mismatches in API route and React component corrected.*

- **Security isolation**: `tenant_portal_role` PostgreSQL role with Row-Level Security on 5 inventory tables. `role=tenant` JWT namespace (admin tokens explicitly rejected). IP binding + Redis session binding. TOTP + email OTP MFA with 8 bcrypt-hashed backup codes.
- **Data endpoints (read-only)**: VM inventory, volume list, snapshot list/detail/history, per-VM compliance %, dashboard summary, event feed, Prometheus metrics proxy (scoped to tenant VMs), runbooks catalogue — 14 routes, all with double `project_id + region_id` scoping and RLS.
- **Restore center**: 6 endpoints (list restore points, dry-run plan, execute, list jobs, progress, cancel). Side-by-side restore always creates a new VM — non-destructive. Ops Slack/Teams alert on execute; tenant email on completion/failure.
- **Network & SG Management** *(v1.85.0)*: `GET /tenant/networks` (subnets, CIDRs, shared/external); `GET /tenant/security-groups/{id}` (rules); `POST/DELETE /tenant/security-groups/{id}/rules` (add/delete rules via Neutron + local DB sync). Internal endpoints: `POST /internal/sg-rule`, `DELETE /internal/sg-rule/{id}`.
- **Dependency Graph** *(v1.85.0, expanded v1.85.3)*: `GET /tenant/resource-graph` returns VM, network, subnet, SG, and volume nodes with 4 edge types (`vm_network`, `vm_sg`, `network_subnet`, `vm_volume`). Rendered as a 5-column SVG layout with colored nodes and legend.
- **VM Provisioning** *(v1.85.0, enhanced v1.85.3)*: `POST /tenant/vms` → `POST /internal/tenant-provision-vm` → `create_boot_volume` + `create_server_bfv`. RFC-1123 name validation, fixed IP picker (subnet CIDR hint), cloud-init user/password fields, boot volume size display. New *New VM* screen (🚀) in the tenant portal nav.
- **K8s crash hotfix** *(v1.85.12)*: `pf9-tenant-ui` nginx config hardcoded Docker Compose service name `tenant_portal` → K8s DNS fails → CrashLoopBackOff. Fixed with envsubst template; Helm sets `TENANT_PORTAL_UPSTREAM=pf9-tenant-portal:8010`. `pf9-monitoring` missing `httpx` in requirements → `ModuleNotFoundError` at startup → CrashLoopBackOff. Added `httpx==0.27.2`.
- **Production fix + branding + error messages + Restore Center** *(v1.85.11)*: `tenant-ui` nginx now proxies `/tenant/*` to `tenant_portal` (was missing — entire portal broken in prod). Branding logo served as base64 data URL for legacy file-path `logo_url` values. `apiFetch` 422 detail-array unwrapped (eliminates `[object Object]` error messages in admin UI). Restore Center: `MANUAL_IP` network/IP selection, post-restore result panel, email summary, expandable history.
- **K8s stability (v1.85.7)**: `apiFetch` no-retry-on-HTTP; quota CP ID slug support; snapshot calendar today-cell highlight; `apiExecuteRunbook` normalised + `RiskBadge`/`statusBadge` null-guarded; monitoring `cache_available` flag in API response + improved empty-state.
- **Per-tenant branding** *(v1.85.6)*: `tenant_portal_branding` table gains `project_id` column (empty = CP-level default); admin scope dropdown to select per-tenant override; `useBranding` re-fetches after login.
- **Runbook Execution** *(v1.85.3)*: `POST /tenant/runbooks/{name}/execute`, `GET /tenant/runbook-executions`; internal `POST /internal/tenant-runbook-execute`, `GET /internal/tenant-runbook-executions`. Execute dialog with dynamic parameter form, dry-run toggle, risk warning banner, execution history tab.
- **VM List & Inventory** *(v1.85.3)*: `disk_gb` via `flavors` JOIN; IP addresses from `raw_json`; both in Infrastructure table and inventory CSV export.
- **Activity Log** *(v1.85.3)*: *User* column — `username` + truncated `keystone_user_id` from `GET /tenant/events`; system events show "system".
- **Dashboard** *(v1.85.3)*: Skipped snapshot events display amber "Skipped" badge instead of red "Failed".
- **Audit logging**: every tenant API call writes an immutable `tenant_action_log` entry atomically with the data query.
- **Branding** *(v1.84.9)*: `GET /tenant/branding` unauthenticated endpoint returns per-CP logo URL, accent colour, portal title, and favicon. 60 s Redis cache; fail-safe defaults when unconfigured.
- **Web SPA** (`tenant-ui/`): React + TypeScript + nginx — 10 screens: Health Overview (default, v1.91.0), Dashboard, Infrastructure (VMs · Volumes · Networks · Security Groups · Dependency Graph), Snapshot Coverage, Monitoring, Restore Center, Runbooks, Reports, New VM (🚀 Provision), Activity Log. Per-customer branding applied from server. Session token silently re-validates on page reload.
- **Admin API** (`api/tenant_portal_routes.py`): 9 admin endpoints — user listing, access management (grant/revoke projects), session management (list/revoke), audit log review, branding upsert *(v1.84.9)*, MFA reset *(v1.84.9)*. Requires `admin` or `superadmin`.
- **Admin UI** *(v1.84.9)*: `TenantPortalTab.tsx` — 4 sub-tabs: Access Management, Branding (logo + accent colour editor), Active Sessions, Audit Log.
- **Kubernetes**: dedicated `nginx-ingress-tenant` Helm release on separate MetalLB IP *(v1.84.8)*; `NetworkPolicy` blocks tenant portal from reaching admin API, LDAP, and SMTP.
- **Security test suite** *(v1.84.9, P8)*: 27 tests (S01–S27) covering unauthenticated access control, token segregation, CSRF resistance, rate limiting, input validation, session invalidation, MFA bypass resistance, and cross-tenant data isolation.
