## Architecture & Data Model

### Hierarchy

```
migration_projects
  └── migration_tenants          (scoped VMware tenants / vCenters)
        └── migration_vms        (individual VMs with risk, mode, status)
              └── migration_vm_dependencies  (ordering constraints)
  └── migration_cohorts          (ordered workstreams within a project)
        └── migration_waves      (execution batches within a cohort)
              └── migration_wave_vms        (VM → wave assignment)
              └── migration_wave_preflights (gate checks per wave)
  └── migration_network_mappings (VMware network → PCD network)
  └── migration_pcd_nodes        (target hardware node profiles)
  └── migration_pcd_gaps         (gap analysis findings)
```

### Key Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Project** | Top-level container for a migration engagement. Has schedule parameters (duration days, working hours, VMs/day, agent slots). |
| **Tenant** | A VMware organisational unit (vCenter folder / logical grouping). Has a source→PCD target mapping, priority, and readiness checks. |
| **VM** | Individual virtual machine. Has risk classification (GREEN/YELLOW/RED), migration mode (warm/cold), status, and optional mode override. |
| **Cohort** | An ordered workstream — a named batch of tenants migrated together. Large projects use multiple cohorts to reduce blast radius. |
| **Wave** | An ordered execution batch within a cohort. A wave contains VMs assigned to it and progresses through a status lifecycle. |
| **Pre-flight** | A gate check that must pass before a wave advances to `executing`. |

---

## Phase 1 — Assessment & Risk Scoring

### Uploading RVTools Data

1. Open a Migration Project.
2. Go to the **📋 Source VMs** sub-tab.
3. Click **Upload RVTools XLSX** and select the exported file.
4. The engine parses `vInfo`, `vPartition`, `vDisk`, `vNetwork`, `vCPU`, and `vMemory` sheets.

**What gets parsed:**

| RVTools Sheet | Data Extracted |
|--------------|---------------|
| `vInfo` | VM name, power state, OS, vCPU, RAM, datastore, cluster, host |
| `vPartition` | Per-disk actual used GB (more accurate than allocated) |
| `vDisk` | Disk count, total allocated GB |
| `vNetwork` | Network adapter names → source network inventory |
| `vCPU` / `vMemory` | Actual usage % for performance-based node sizing |

### Risk Classification

Each VM is scored GREEN / YELLOW / RED based on cumulative risk factors:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| OS unsupported on PCD | +RED |
| Large disk (>2 TB) | +YELLOW |
| Many vNICs (>4) | +YELLOW |
| High vCPU (>16) | +YELLOW |
| Compressed/deduplicated storage hints | +YELLOW |
| 100% disk utilisation | +YELLOW/RED |

**GREEN** = straightforward warm migration candidate.
**YELLOW** = needs review; likely warm-eligible with caveats.
**RED** = cold migration required or manual intervention needed.

### Migration Mode

| Mode | When Assigned | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `warm_migration` | Default for GREEN/YELLOW | Live sync with minimal cutover window (~minutes) |
| `cold_migration` | Default for RED, or operator override | VM powered off for migration. Longer downtime. |

Operators can **force-override** the mode on any VM using the 🔒 mode override toggle.

### Daily Wave Schedule

The engine calculates a day-by-day schedule from project parameters using a **shared-pipe throughput model** (v1.44.0+):

#### Throughput model

```
effective_gbph  = (bottleneck_mbps / 8) × 3600 / 1024 × AVG_BW_EFFICIENCY
max_gb_per_day  = effective_gbph × working_hours_per_day
```

Where:
- `bottleneck_mbps` — resolved by `compute_bandwidth_model()` as the minimum of source NIC, WAN link, agent ingest, and PCD storage write speeds.
- `AVG_BW_EFFICIENCY = 0.55` — realistic utilisation factor accounting for TCP slow-start, I/O burst gaps, and multi-agent coordination overhead.
- At 4 000 Mbps bottleneck and an 8-hour working day, `max_gb_per_day ≈ 7 742 GB` (~7.6 TB/day).

#### Day packing

VMs are added to the current day until `day_transfer_gb + vm_transfer_gb > max_gb_per_day`, then the day is closed and a new one opens.

`vm_transfer_gb` is:
- **warm migration** → `vm.in_use_gb` (only used blocks are transferred)
- **cold migration** → `vm.total_disk_gb` (full provisioned disk)

#### Wall-clock time

```
wall_clock_hours = day_transfer_gb / effective_gbph
```

This is the calendar time required to drain the day's entire data payload through the bottleneck pipe at the modelled efficiency. When `wall_clock_hours > working_hours_per_day` the day entry is flagged `over_capacity: true` and highlighted in the UI with a ⚠️ indicator. This can occur when a single VM's data payload exceeds one day's throughput capacity (the VM is never split across days).

#### Agent time vs wall-clock time

| Metric | Formula | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `total_agent_hours` | Σ per-VM agent time | Total agent-slot hours across all VMs (parallelism increases throughput) |
| `wall_clock_hours` | `day_transfer_gb / effective_gbph` | Actual elapsed time for the day (pipe is the constraint) |

#### Legacy parameters (still configurable, no longer the primary constraint)

- `migration_duration_days` — maximum calendar days; plan stops after this
- `working_hours_per_day` — shift length used in throughput and wall-clock calculations
- `target_vms_per_day` — optional VM-count soft cap per day
- `migration_agent_slots` — parallel agent connections (affects per-VM time, not the GB/day ceiling)


### Export

`GET /api/migration/projects/{id}/export-plan` returns the full plan as Excel (`.xlsx`) with tabs:
- **Project Summary** — parameters, totals, risk breakdown
- **Per-Tenant Assessment** — cohort-grouped tenant table with target mapping
- **Daily Schedule** — day-by-day VM list with cohort separator rows
- **All VMs** — full VM inventory with risk, mode, disk, OS

---

## Phase 2 — Scoping, Target Mapping & Capacity Planning

### Tenant Scoping

In the **👥 Tenants** sub-tab:
- Toggle each tenant **In Scope** / **Out of Scope**. Out-of-scope tenants are excluded from the schedule and plan.
- Set **Migration Priority** (integer, lower = earlier) to control cohort auto-assign ordering.
- Set **Target Domain Name**, **Target Project Name**, and optional descriptions — these map to PCD's domain/project structure.
- Use **🔍 Find & Replace** to bulk-rename target fields across all tenants at once. Affected rows revert to unconfirmed for review.
- Use **✓ Confirm All** to bulk-confirm mappings once reviewed.

### Network Mapping

In the **🔌 Network Map** sub-tab:
- One row is auto-seeded per distinct source VMware network (from `vNetwork` sheet).
- Fill in the **Target Network Name** (PCD network that VMs will attach to post-migration).
- Optionally set/correct the **VLAN ID** (editable inline with ✏️ button).
- Unconfirmed rows show ⚠️ — confirm each row after review, or use **✓ Confirm All**.
- Use **🔍 Find & Replace (Network Map)** to bulk-rename target network names.
- Stale mappings (networks that no longer appear in the latest RVTools upload) are automatically purged on re-import.

> **Readiness Impact**: The `network_mapped` readiness check is `pending` until all in-scope-tenant networks are confirmed. Waves cannot safely advance until this resolves.

### Overcommit Profiles

Three built-in profiles control how physical resources are calculated:

| Profile | vCPU Overcommit | RAM Overcommit | Use Case |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| `conservative` | 2:1 | 1.2:1 | Business-critical / production |
| `balanced` | 4:1 | 1.5:1 | Mixed workloads (default) |
| `aggressive` | 8:1 | 2:1 | Dev/test |

### Node Sizing (Performance-Based)

The node sizing engine uses **actual RVTools usage data** when `cpu_usage_percent` / `memory_usage_percent` columns have ≥50% coverage. Otherwise falls back to allocation ÷ overcommit → quota.

```
physical_vcpu_demand = sum(vm.vcpu × (vm.cpu_usage_pct / 100)) / overcommit_ratio
physical_ram_demand  = sum(vm.ram_gb × (vm.mem_usage_pct / 100)) / overcommit_ratio
nodes_required       = ceil(max(cpu_demand / node_vcpu, ram_demand / node_ram_gb) / 0.70)
```

> **70% utilisation cap IS the HA strategy.** No separate spare nodes are allocated on top. This mirrors VMware's N+1 headroom: keep the cluster at ≤70% so any single-node failure has headroom.

### PCD Gap Analysis

`POST /api/migration/projects/{id}/analyze-gaps` compares the computed requirements against a live or manually entered PCD inventory and produces gap findings:

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `critical` | Blocker — migration cannot proceed without remediation |
| `warning` | Risk — likely to cause issues; should be resolved |
| `info` | Advisory — no immediate impact |

Gap categories: vCPU quota, RAM quota, Cinder disk quota, missing networks, missing flavors, domain/project not created.

Download the gap action report from `GET /api/migration/projects/{id}/gap-report` (Excel/PDF).

---

## Phase 2.10 — Pre-Wave Foundations

### Migration Cohorts

Cohorts let you split a large project into **independent ordered workstreams**. Each cohort:
- Has its own owner, schedule window, and dependency gate (cannot start until the previous cohort is complete)
- Contains a subset of tenants (and through them, their VMs)
- Has its own wave plan (Phase 3)

**If no cohorts are created**, all functionality continues to work with the full project treated as a single implicit cohort.

#### Creating Cohorts

In the **🗃️ Cohorts** sub-tab → **➕ New Cohort**. Set:
- Name, description, owner
- `order` (integer) — processing sequence; cohorts execute in ascending order
- `max_vms_per_day`, `working_hours_per_day` (override project-level if set)

#### Auto-Assigning Tenants to Cohorts

Click **🤖 Smart Auto-Assign** to open the auto-assign panel:

| Strategy | Logic |
|----------|-------|
| `easiest_first` | Lowest ease-score (simplest) tenants go into the earliest cohorts |
| `riskiest_last` | Highest-risk tenants pushed to later cohorts |
| `pilot_bulk` | First cohort = pilot (small/easy), remaining cohorts = bulk |
| `balanced_load` | Distribute to balance disk GB per cohort |
| `os_first` | Tenants with best OS support % go first |
| `by_priority` | Respects the `migration_priority` integer on each tenant |

**Guardrails** (all optional):
- `max_vms_per_cohort` — hard cap on VM count per cohort
- `max_disk_tb` — hard cap on total disk per cohort
- `max_avg_risk` — reject assignments above a risk threshold
- `min_os_support_pct` — require a minimum OS compatibility percentage

Always run **Preview** before **Apply** to review the diff table.

**Ramp Profile mode** — instead of a fixed number of cohorts, define named cohort "slots" each with their own VM cap:
- Presets: Pilot+Bulk, 3-Wave, 4-Wave, 5-Wave
- Custom cohort rows with editable names and VM caps

> **Rebuilding cohorts from scratch?** If you ran auto-assign before finalising your exclusion list, stale assignments from excluded tenants exist in the database. Use:
> ```
> DELETE /api/migration/projects/{id}/cohorts
> ```
> This wipes all cohort groups and clears every tenant's `cohort_id` (including stale excluded-tenant rows). Then re-run auto-assign — results will reflect only in-scope tenants.

### VM Dependency Annotation

In the expanded VM row → **Dependencies** tab:
- Add `depends_on: [vm_b_id]` to mark that VM A cannot start until VM B is complete.
- Circular dependencies are rejected at the API level.
- The wave planner uses the dependency graph to prevent cross-wave violations.

### Per-VM Migration Status

VM status values (colour-coded in the VM table):

| Status | Colour | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `not_started` | ⬜ Grey | Not yet assigned to a wave |
| `assigned` | 🔵 Blue | Assigned to a wave but not yet executing |
| `in_progress` | 🟡 Amber | Wave is actively executing this VM |
| `migrated` | 🟢 Green | Successfully migrated |
| `failed` | 🔴 Red | Migration attempt failed |
| `skipped` | ⬛ Dark | Deliberately excluded from all waves |

### Per-Tenant Readiness Checks

Five auto-derived checks appear on each tenant row:

| Check | Source | Passes When |
|-------|--------|------------|
| `target_mapped` | `migration_tenants` | `target_domain_name` is confirmed |
| `network_mapped` | `migration_network_mappings` | All networks for this tenant's VMs are confirmed |
| `quota_sufficient` | Gap analysis | No critical quota gaps for this tenant |
| `no_critical_gaps` | Gap analysis | No critical gaps of any kind |
| `vms_classified` | `migration_vms` | All VMs have a risk classification |

---

## Phase 3.0 — Cohort Planning

### Ease Score

Each tenant receives an **Ease Score** (0–100, lower = easier) composed of 8 dimensions:

| Dimension | Higher Score When |
|-----------|------------------|
| Total disk used | Large disk footprint |
| Average VM risk | More RED/YELLOW VMs |
| Unsupported OS % | Many non-supported guest OSes |
| VM count | Large number of VMs |
| Distinct networks | Many distinct source networks |
| Cross-tenant dependencies | VMs depend on VMs in other tenants |
| Cold VM ratio | High proportion of cold-only VMs |
| Unconfirmed mappings | Target names / networks not yet confirmed |

The score drives the auto-assign strategy logic and appears as a colour-coded badge in the Tenants tab (🟢 Easy / 🟡 Medium / 🔴 Hard).

### What-If Estimator

Two parallel models estimate migration duration:

**BW Days** (bandwidth/transfer model):
```
eff_mbps       = bandwidth_gbps × 1000 × 0.75
transfer_hours = (total_in_use_gb × 1024 × 8) / (eff_mbps × 3600) × 1.14
cutover_hours  = tenant_count × 0.25 / agent_slots
bw_days        = (transfer_hours + cutover_hours) / working_hours_per_day
```

**Sched. Days** (VM-slots model — mirrors the backend scheduler exactly):
```
sched_days = vm_count / effective_vms_per_day
```

A **deadline banner** compares both models against `migration_duration_days` and turns red if either exceeds the budget.

---

## Phase 3 — Wave Planning

### Concepts

A **wave** is an ordered, gate-controlled execution batch within a cohort. Waves have:
- A **type**: `regular`, `pilot`, or `cleanup`
- A **status lifecycle** with enforced transitions
- A set of assigned VMs (sourced from the cohort's tenant pool)
- A **pre-flight checklist** that gates advancement to `executing`

### Wave Status Lifecycle

```
planned
  ├── pre_checks_passed   ← all pre-flight checks passed
  │     ├── executing     ← wave actively running
  │     │     ├── validating   ← post-migration checks
  │     │     │     ├── complete  ✅
  │     │     │     └── failed    ❌
  │     │     └── failed    ❌
  │     ├── planned        ← rolled back
  │     └── cancelled      🚫
  └── cancelled            🚫

failed / cancelled → planned   ← reopen for retry
```

Transitions are enforced at the API level — you cannot skip steps.

### Auto-Building a Wave Plan

In the **🌊 Wave Planner** sub-tab → **🤖 Auto-Build Waves**:

#### Strategies

| Strategy | Logic |
|----------|-------|
| `pilot_first` | Wave 0 = N lowest-risk, smallest VMs (configurable count). Remaining VMs fill subsequent waves. Use this to validate the toolchain before committing bulk VMs. |
| `by_tenant` | One wave per tenant, sorted by `migration_priority`. Large tenants are split if they exceed the VM cap. |
| `by_risk` | Wave 1 = GREEN (low risk) → Wave 2 = YELLOW → Wave 3+ = RED. Fail fast on safe VMs before attempting risky ones. |
| `by_priority` | Fill waves in tenant priority order (lower integer = earlier). Same-priority tenants spread evenly. |
| `balanced` | Distribute VMs to minimise variance in total disk GB per wave — each wave takes roughly equal time. |

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Max VMs per wave | 30 | Hard cap on VMs per wave |
| Pilot VM count | 5 | (pilot_first only) number of VMs in Wave 0 |
| Wave name prefix | "Wave" | E.g. "Wave 1", "Wave 2" |
| Cohort filter | All | Scope auto-build to a specific cohort |

#### Cohort-aware building

When cohorts are defined and **All Cohorts** is selected, the engine builds waves **cohort-by-cohort** in `cohort_order` sequence:
- Each cohort gets its own pilot wave (named `🧪 <Cohort Name>`) plus as many regular waves as needed to fit within the Max VMs/wave cap (named `<Cohort Name> 1`, `<Cohort Name> 2`, …).
- Each wave is tagged with its `cohort_id` — waves from different cohorts never mix.
- VMs not assigned to any cohort are grouped last as "Unassigned".
- The preview table shows a **Cohort** column and a cohort count badge when multiple cohorts are present.

When a **specific cohort** is selected, only VMs/tenants in that cohort are included.

**Always run Preview first.** The preview table shows wave number, name, cohort, type, VM count, total disk GB, risk distribution, and tenant names — plus any warnings (e.g. cross-wave dependency violations).

Once satisfied, click **✅ Apply & Create Waves**.

### Managing Waves Manually

`POST /api/migration/projects/{id}/waves` — create a wave with:
```json
{
  "wave_number": 1,
  "name": "Wave 1 — Finance",
  "wave_type": "regular",
  "cohort_id": 3,
  "scheduled_start": "2026-03-15",
  "scheduled_end": "2026-03-17",
  "owner_name": "ops-team",
  "agent_slots_override": 4
}
```

### Assigning VMs to a Wave

`POST /api/migration/projects/{id}/waves/{wave_id}/assign-vms`:
```json
{
  "vm_ids": [101, 102, 103],
  "replace": false
}
```
- `replace: true` — remove all current assignments and replace with the given list
- Assigned VMs have their `migration_status` set to `assigned`

Remove a single VM: `DELETE /projects/{id}/waves/{wave_id}/vms/{vm_id}` — reverts VM status to `not_started` if not in any other wave.

> **Rebuilding waves from scratch?** If cohorts or exclusions changed after waves were built, reset with:
> ```
> DELETE /api/migration/projects/{id}/waves
> ```
> This deletes all waves, removes all wave-VM assignments, and resets `migration_status` back to `not_started` for assigned VMs. Then re-run auto-build. Recommended sequence after changing exclusions:
> 1. `DELETE /cohorts` — wipe all cohort groups
> 2. `DELETE /waves` — wipe all wave groups
> 3. `POST /cohorts/auto-assign` — rebuild cohorts
> 4. `POST /auto-waves` — rebuild waves

### Pre-Flight Checklists

Each wave has 6 pre-flight checks seeded automatically on creation:

| Check | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `network_mapped` | blocker | All VM networks in this wave have confirmed PCD mappings |
| `target_project_set` | blocker | Target PCD project/domain is confirmed for all tenants |
| `vms_assessed` | warning | All VMs have risk classification and mode set |
| `no_critical_gaps` | blocker | No unresolved critical PCD capacity/quota gaps |
| `agent_reachable` | warning | Migration agent has connectivity to source and target |
| `snapshot_baseline` | info | Pre-migration snapshot taken for rollback |

**Severity meanings:**

| Severity | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `blocker` | Failing check should prevent advancing to `executing` |
| `warning` | Should be resolved but operator can override |
| `info` | Best-practice advisory only |

Update a check via the UI (✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⏭️ Skip buttons) or:
```
PATCH /api/migration/projects/{id}/waves/{wave_id}/preflights/{check_name}
{"check_status": "pass", "notes": "Confirmed by network team 2026-03-14"}
```

### Advancing a Wave

Click the advance button on the wave card, or:
```
POST /api/migration/projects/{id}/waves/{wave_id}/advance
{"status": "executing", "notes": "All pre-checks passed, starting now"}
```

Timestamps `started_at` and `completed_at` are set automatically on `executing` and terminal states (`complete`, `failed`, `cancelled`).

### VM Migration Funnel

`GET /api/migration/projects/{id}/migration-funnel` returns a rollup:
```json
{
  "funnel": {
    "total": 420,
    "not_started": 285,
    "assigned": 60,
    "in_progress": 15,
    "migrated": 52,
    "failed": 4,
    "skipped": 4
  }
}
```

Displayed as a colour-coded progress bar at the top of the Wave Planner tab.

## Phase 4A — PCD Data Enrichment

> Prerequisite: Wave plan built and reviewed (Phase 3 complete).

Phase 4A collects the information that cannot be derived from RVTools — the actual PCD target configuration. All four items must be confirmed before Phase 4B can run.

| Sub-phase | What you configure | API |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| **4A.1 Subnet Details** | CIDR, gateway, DNS, DHCP pool start/end per confirmed network mapping | `PATCH /network-mappings/{id}`, `POST /network-mappings/confirm-all` |
| **4A.2 Flavor Staging** | Review de-duplicated (vCPU, RAM) shapes; rename, Find & Replace, confirm or skip | `GET/PATCH /flavor-staging`, `POST /flavor-staging/confirm-all` |
| **4A.3 Image Requirements** | One row per OS family; confirm after uploading to PCD Glance | `GET/PATCH /image-requirements`, `POST /image-requirements/confirm-all` |
| **4A.4 Tenant Users** | Define service accounts and owner accounts per tenant; seed all-tenant owner accounts in bulk, bulk find-and-replace fields, confirm & bulk-action | `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /tenant-users`, `POST /tenant-users/seed-tenant-owners`, `POST /tenant-users/bulk-replace`, `POST /tenant-users/confirm-all`, `POST /tenant-users/bulk-action` |

The **⚙️ Prepare PCD** tab gate (`GET /prep-readiness`) will show red ✗ for any unfinished item.

---

## Phase 4B — PCD Auto-Provisioning

> Prerequisite: All Phase 4A items confirmed.

### Workflow

1. Open the **⚙️ Prepare PCD** sub-tab in the Migration Planner.
2. Verify the Readiness grid shows all four cards green.
3. Click **🔄 Generate Plan** — calls `POST /prepare`, creates an ordered task list and sets plan status to `pending_approval`. A `prep_approval_requested` notification is fired to subscribed admins.
4. Review the task table (ordered: `create_domain` → `create_project` → `set_quotas` → `create_network` → `create_subnet` → `create_flavor` → `create_user` → `assign_role`).
5. *(Optional)* Click **🧪 Dry Run** — simulates execution against a live PCD without writing anything. Review the `would_create` / `would_skip_existing` / `would_execute` breakdown per task type.
6. An **admin** (requires `migration:admin` permission) approves or rejects the plan using the inline approval banner or `POST /prep-approval`. The person who generated the plan cannot approve their own plan (separation of duties).
7. Once the banner turns green (approved), **▶ Run All** becomes available. Click it to open the confirmation modal showing resource counts, then confirm to execute all pending tasks in order.
8. Failed tasks show an inline error — fix the root cause and use the per-row **▶** button to re-run the individual task.
9. Use **↩ Rollback** on any `done` task to delete the PCD resource and reset it to `pending`.
10. Use **📋 Audit Log** to review the full approval history, activity log, and execution history.
11. When all tasks are `done` or `skipped`, Phase 4B is complete — PCD UUIDs are written back to all source tables.

### Task Types

| Task Type | What it does | Writes back |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `create_domain` | Creates a Keystone domain; skips if already exists | — |
| `create_project` | Creates a Keystone project under its domain | — |
| `set_quotas` | Applies Nova + Neutron + Cinder quotas (from overcommit profile) | — |
| `create_network` | Creates provider network (VLAN type) or tenant network | `migration_network_mappings.target_network_id` |
| `create_subnet` | Creates subnet with CIDR, gateway, DNS, DHCP pool | — |
| `create_flavor` | Creates Nova flavor; skips if already exists | `migration_flavor_staging.pcd_flavor_id` |
| `create_user` | Creates Keystone user with auto-generated temp password | `migration_tenant_users.pcd_user_id`, `.temp_password` |
| `assign_role` | Assigns role to user in project | — |

## vJailbreak Handoff Exports

> Prerequisite: Phase 4B complete (all provisioning tasks `done` or `skipped`).

Once PCD resources are provisioned the Migration Planner can produce two handoff artifacts for the execution phase:

### vJailbreak Credential Bundle (JSON)

A JSON document containing everything vJailbreak needs to connect to each PCD project and start migrating VMs: PCD project UUID, service-account credentials, all user temporary passwords, network UUIDs with CIDR/gateway/VLAN, and cohort/wave sequence.

- **Full project** — `GET /api/migration/projects/{id}/export-vjailbreak-bundle`
- **Single cohort** — `GET /api/migration/projects/{id}/cohorts/{cid}/export-vjailbreak-bundle`

If any tenants are missing service accounts or PCD project IDs (provisioning incomplete) the response includes a `warnings[]` array but still returns the partial bundle.

### vJailbreak Agent Status & Wave Execution (v1.45.0)

Once a vJailbreak agent is deployed, set `VJAILBREAK_API_URL` in the API environment and use these endpoints:

**GET** `/api/migration/projects/{id}/vjailbreak-status`  
Returns agent connectivity: `not_configured`, `connected`, or `unreachable`.

```json
{ "status": "connected", "message": "vJailbreak agent is reachable.", "agent_url": "https://vj.example.com" }
```

**POST** `/api/migration/projects/{id}/waves/{wave_id}/execute`  
*Requires: `migration:admin`*  
Forwards the wave to the vJailbreak REST API. Returns HTTP 503 with a clear message when the agent URL is not configured.

Request body (optional):
```json
{ "dry_run": false, "notes": "Executing wave 1 – low-risk tenants" }
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "wave": { "id": 1, "wave_number": 1, "name": "Wave 1", "status": "planned", "tenant_count": 3 },
  "vjailbreak_response": { ... },
  "dry_run": false
}
```

### Tenant Handoff Sheet (PDF)

A CONFIDENTIAL A4 PDF document — one section per in-scope tenant — containing:
- Domain/project identity and PCD auth URL
- Network mappings: source name, target UUID, CIDR, gateway, VLAN
- User roster with temporary passwords (service accounts highlighted)
- Confidentiality notice on every page

`GET /api/migration/projects/{id}/export-handoff-sheet.pdf`

> ⚠️ This document contains plaintext temporary passwords. Distribute to tenants through a secure channel (encrypted email, password manager share, in-person handoff).

### UI

Both export buttons appear automatically in the **⚙️ Prepare PCD** tab once all provisioning tasks reach `done` or `skipped`. Click:
- **📦 vJailbreak Credential Bundle** to download the JSON file
- **📄 Tenant Handoff Sheet** to download the PDF

## Phase 5.0 — Migration Summary & Fix Time

> Accessible via the **📊 Summary** sub-tab in Source Analysis.

Phase 5.0 adds a post-migration effort model and an executive-level Migration Summary view. After VMs land on PCD there is always a "fix window" — time spent renaming NICs, fixing UUIDs, re-verifying routes, etc. Phase 5.0 quantifies this upfront so planners can present a realistic total project timeline.

### Fix Time Model

| Factor | Default (min) | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Windows OS | 20 | NIC rename, drive letter reassignment |
| Extra data volume | 15 / disk | fstab / UUID changes |
| Extra NIC | 10 / NIC | Multi-IP, routes, DNS re-verify |
| Cold migration | 15 | Higher stale-driver risk at first boot |
| Elevated risk (Yellow, >50) | 15 | Flagged by risk scorer |
| High risk (Red, >75) | 25 | Complex VM |
| Has snapshots | 10 | Disk-chain consolidation |
| Cross-tenant dependency | 15 | Coordinated cutover |
| Unknown / other OS | 20 | Unpredictable boot behaviour |
| Cutover window (always) | 30 | Final sync + first boot |

**OS-family fix rates** (% of VMs expected to need any intervention): Windows 50%, Linux 20%, Other / Unknown 40%. All rates and all 10 weights are configurable per project via the Settings editor in the Summary tab.

### Per-VM Fix Override

Any VM can have `tech_fix_minutes_override` set, locking it to an operator-supplied value and bypassing the model. The ⏱ Fix Time Override card in the expanded VM row provides a number input, Save, and Clear button. The `🔒 Xm` amber pill in the VM table reflects the override immediately.

### Migration Summary Tab  *(v1.44.0 — per-day breakdown)*

- **Executive KPI strip** — Migration Days (blue), In-Use Data (TB) with provisioned subtitle (`X GB used / Y TB provisioned`), Estimated Data-Copy Time (h), Estimated Fix Time (h), Total Downtime (h)
- **Per-day schedule table** — one row per calendar day with: Cohort/Wave, Tenants, VMs, Storage GB (in-use), Wall-clock (h), Agent Total (h), ❄️ Cold, 🔥 Warm, 🟢/🟡/🔴 risk counts. Over-capacity days (`wall_clock_hours > working_hours_per_day`) are highlighted in red with a ⚠️ prefix.
- **OS-family table** — VM count + fix rate + data + fix time per OS family
- **Per-cohort table** — VM count, data (GB), copy time, fix time, downtime exposure per cohort
- **Methodology accordion** — expands to explain all three calculations in plain language
- **Settings editor** — 10 weight sliders + 3 fix-rate fields; **💾 Save & Recalculate** applies changes and refreshes

> **Alignment guarantee**: the Summary tab runs the same `generate_migration_plan()` engine as the Export Plan endpoint — day counts, cohort assignments, and GB totals are always identical.

### API

## Troubleshooting

### "Readiness check `network_mapped` stuck at pending"

All source networks for the tenant's VMs must have a confirmed mapping row in `migration_network_mappings`. Go to **🔌 Network Map**, find rows with ⚠️ status, fill in the target name, and click ✓ Confirm.

### "Wave won't advance to `executing`"

Check the pre-flight checklist. All `blocker`-severity checks must be in `pass` status before the API will accept a status advance to `executing`. Use the Checks panel to identify failing blockers.

### "Auto-build produced unexpected wave assignments"

Run with `dry_run: true` first and inspect the preview table. Common causes:
- Many VMs have `migration_status = migrated` or `skipped` — they are excluded from auto-build automatically.
- Cross-wave dependency warnings appear if VM A's dependency VM B is placed in a later wave. Review and manually move VMs if needed.
- `max_vms_per_wave` too low for the `by_tenant` strategy — large tenants get split across multiple waves.

### "DELETE wave returns 400"

Waves can only be deleted when their status is `planned`. Advance the wave to `cancelled` first, then delete.

### "Missing `in_use_gb` values on VMs"

This means the `vPartition` sheet was absent or empty in the uploaded RVTools file. The engine falls back to `total_disk_gb × 0.6` as an estimate. Re-export RVTools with the vPartition sheet included for accurate values.

### Re-uploading RVTools after creating waves

`DELETE /projects/{id}/rvtools` (Clear RVTools Data) will also remove all network mappings, cohorts, waves, and wave VM assignments — the entire planning state is reset. Export your current plan first if you need a record.
